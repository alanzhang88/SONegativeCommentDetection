In that typeclasses have 1. subtyping 2. implicit self reference 3. replaceable self reference (aka inheritance).  A typeclass is just a (parameterized) abstract class in oop while an instance is just an object that inherits from that abstract class.  With GHC 7.4 and some trickery involving `newtype`, `unsafeCoerce` and implicit parameters this correspondence becomes complete.",

It just happens to be an Object Oriented layer to for defining predicates over Haskell types.",

The \"Haskell's Overlooked Object System\" paper has a good discussion of why typeclasses don't do the job (and hence what it proposes instead), and I think the O'Haskell paper also motivate the differences quite well. Anyway, implicit parameters are not idiomatic Haskell these days, and unlikely to make it into a standard, and once you start to involve unsafeCoerce then you're clearly off the reservation.",
        "@sclv I'm not sure what either of those papers have to do with my claim.  The class per class encoding is clumsy, I agree. My point is more subtle.  Typeclasses in Haskell are classes over types.  We are all constructivist here, so for us to suppose a type is a member of a typeclass requires some sort of \"evidence object\".  Further, the language provides an automatic theorem proving system in the form of inference and global instances.  My claim is only that the proof language for this logic is OO, and it is helpful for reasoning about Haskell to be aware of this fact.",

Implicit this references and inheritance are what let you declare `m >> k = m >>= \\_ -> k\" in the definition of `Monad`.  To simulate this behavior with records requires finding a fix-point (as pointed out by Oleg), which should clue you in something is up.  The reason this shouldn't be surprising is that typeclasses sit on the other-side of the \"expresion problem\" from Abstract Data Types.  From William Cooks work we know that means they are probably objects.",
        "Obviously this object system is a restricted one, but you just need to look at Bruno Oliveira's work to know that is a non-essential aspect (see Scala's implicits).  My point about `unsafeCoerce` is that with some extensions and unsafe features you can actually get your hands on the Objects that bare witness to type-class membership  , and using implicit parameters you can construct arbitrary such instances at runtime (although it relies on the compiler not obeying its documentation).",
        "@PhilipJF the \"evidence type\" for membership in Ord (dictionary, I suppose you mean) isn't a subtype of the evidence type for membership in Eq. It's just that Ord membership implies Eq membership. An ord instance can't \"override\" Eq methods. I have no idea what you're getting at with the monad example -- yes if you encode monads with objects, then the encoding is object-y, but that's because you chose an object-y encoding to begin with! Anyway, this \"evidence type\" doesn't always exist. Other implementations of Haskell, such as JHC, show you can go very far without a dictionary encoding.",
