OnShow is NOT where you INITIALIZE the form! That should be done inside of OnCreate. OnShow is called every time a ShowModal occurs. Your code isn't calling ShowModal.

"No, you will need to learn how to debug code. Besides, this looks like a learning exercise, so what good does it make to ask a broad ""fix my code"" question? Where's the learning in that?",0
But you haven't said what the problem is! Should we *guess* what you need help with? All you have done is posting a bunch of code without any description of your problem whatsoever. You haven't even said what sorting algorithm you're trying to implement.,0
Is this homework? This is the third time I've seen this same question from different people in the past few days.,0
"Stan, why should anybody need to ""figure out"" your question? Ask the question and take your time to explain it! Be [precise](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#beprecise) and [explicit](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#explicit). Most people answering here won't copy your code and try to run it, we read your problem description and run the code in our heads trying to see where things goes wrong.",0
"Well, why should I waste 2 hours searching for an answer? So far the only similar questions were sorting WORDS or using the _.sort_ method. So, why not?",0
"@Moderatorpleasedeletethis There's no meaningful difference between sorting numbers or words; the algorithm would be the same--and there are *tons* of examples, in many languages, showing tons of algorithms. The issue isn't, however, one of *what* you're trying to do--it's with the question itself.",0
"@Moderatorpleasedeletethis Editing your two down-voted questions is likely hopeless; I'd start over. But here's the thing--don't just say ""help me with the code"". Describe precisely what isn't working, what your expectations are *in detail* (e.g., not just ""it should sort the numbers""--no shit, you're writing a sort algorithm, unless it's a bogosort or random sort, we assume you want them in *some* order), and so on.",0

"**NO**, you can not do that from a website. And I am very glad you can not. Also, Control-Alt-Delete is *meant* not to be able to be captured by a normal program as a security feature (so that you know that the resulting prompt could only be from Windows itself)",0

"To be honest, you are all a bit quick to judge from the question alone. There are valid applications where stuff like this is useful or even mandatory: cashpoints, school assignments, kiosk apps in production lines, ...",0
"@phresnel - we were quick to judge because the question did not contain important, relevant information.  The phrase 'kiosk app' would have prevented all the aggro.  The point is that such apps as you mention are run on secure hardware, often with special human-interfaces, eg. keypads, touchscreens, not a standard PC keyboard.  The desire of the OP can certainly be met, (on XP anyway, as anyone who has used a hotel lobby pay-per-minute internet kiosk will know), but I'm not sure how it's done - it's probably non-trivial.",0
What exactly are you asking?,0
"@user1781384, Then next time, don't tag `java`!!!!!!!",0

If you want a generic solution there's an `Language Agnostic` tag you should be using.,0
Have you tried it?,0
"Did you try it? And **why not**? Also even if it is valid _syntactically_, it is not wise because of the _semantics_ to use an `int` with the name `π`. As you might have heard of it, `π` is a mathemathical constant...",0

First of all you should learn Objective-C.,0
What doesn't work? #What error do you get? What have you done to troubleshoot this?,0
this makes no sense(returns a constant if you initialize the variables) and doesn't even compile because you use uninitialized variables.,0
"*if the guy types in ""haha lol XD""*  ....then you should probably beat the crap out of him.",0
This question appears to be off-topic because it is too-localised.,0
"Did you try looking for ""loop javascrip"" or ""javascript interval"" ? Do it.",0

Good luck getting one.  I would expect these to be totally identical.,0

This is horrible advice - and only artificially extends how many more fragments you can pack in - this problem still remains. Google explicitly states not to use this to address memory leaks.,0
You should never store the password in plaintext.,0
"if you guys don't like my opinion just post something else... it is a matter of opinion after all, I changed some of my phrasings, I think some people got very sentimental about this",0

Unlucky the guy's answer got accepted because that pins the answer up. You often only see a few because they sink to the bottom pretty quickly so nobody pays attention to it. :),0
"whenever you learn a new language, the first thing you should read are the operators. read the reference before posting",0
