"in stroustrups book it says
an ordinary member function declaration specifies three logically distinct things
1 the function can access the private part of the class declaration and 
2 the function is in the scope of the class and 
3 the function must be invoked on an object  has a this pointer
however in a textbook i am reading they give an example of a class  person  and they say that it is equivalent to the exact same thing plus this  and then they say 
in the latter case the this pointer is used explicitly and in the former case it is used implicitly",1

it may emulate integral numbers but it is not one it is a class type implicit conversions — particularly to builtin types — are evil sometimes a direct answer is harmful of course in this case its hard to tell what the real use case is since this particularly example is so contrived and does nothing but wrap int,1
this is not even close to answering the upper question,1
also a recommendation to try to improve the formatting of your code that you post in here and your code in general good formatting including using an indentation style that is uniform and consistent will help others us to better understand your code and more importantly it will help you to better understand your code and thus fix your own bugs also it shows that youre willing to put in extra effort to make it easier for the volunteers here to help you and that effort is much appreciated,1

although the compiler will automatically set the c string size for you its good practice to specify the exact size so you get to see the mechanics of everything  this sentence is dangerously misleading or plain wrong what you perhaps meant to say is that the compiler automatically adds 0 to a string literal ie abc is actually a 4character array,1
regarding this kind of line float anglea  300   the variable anglea is declared as float so the initialization value needs to also be declared as float   suggest float anglea  300f   note the trailing f   the posted code is using a double initializer the default when a decimal point in the initializer is double unless specifically declared otherwise via the trailing f,1
  the code contains no pointers no arrays no calls to new etc  so the only thing i can see that would cause it to not work is and this is the third time mentioning this  your functions that are marked as returning string that fail to return a string are the most likely cause for the errors  playing around commenting out things is not going to fix that problem  either make those functions void or return a string,1

this is not a 2d array and the logic is flawed first free individual arrays that are no longer needed if any then resize your array of pointers then allocate newly needed individual arrays and resize those that were there before and of course check for errors on each malloc  realloc call finally modifying a local variable modifies a copy you have to eg return img when youre done,1

do you want to replace all series of one or more digits which are not zeroes are in range 19 with  if that is the case than why in your result there are more zeroes than at in your input,1
  even if you changed the function to return int youd still likely leak memory because people dont expect that a int returned from a function was allocated with new so they wont call delete returnedint edit however it is indeed legal a bit obscene but legal in c,1

  the op made the mistake of tagging with two different languages your comment applies completely to c but the second half is wrong in c not your problem but the ops also i tend to avoid the parenthesis in sizeof which are not needed for values but are needed for types if in code i see parenthesis i remove them it either builds or has to be changed ptr  malloc sizeof ptr   ,1

this is like saying i dont know how to unlock my car with the key but hey look i managed to open it by smashing the window with a brick,0
  that doesnt make any sense dont say anything whatever comes to your mind if you understand correctly i recently said that the form is creating directly and this form1 is a variable is automatically declared the moment i created this form at design time so the way form is created and in formshow event atleast form1 object should not be nil then i reapeat again for you since form1 was nil thats why i tried to create it now say for eample if i need to call any method of tform1 class in ttest class method on some other button click event then how do i call it ,0
  rd if somebody respect others then there is point in respecting them for me too i find this is the ugliest way of communicating by talking about others ability i dont want to continue about that topic any more since i dont value such ppl there are better way to convey your message and he is not something indigenous,0
  in the code is your comment with tform1create  you create an instance of tform1 but that doesnt assign the result to your form1 variable  thats why form1 is still nil  if you spent less time commenting about imagined slurs and more time taking the trouble to understand what people are saying you would have fewer of these problems,0
 martyna thanks for your advance suggestion but if you little bit try to understand i am not unnecessarily interested in wasting my words with such not useful comments the code i shared what would you do if you need to access tform1s methods via ttest method  better you stop suggesting what should i do and what i should not i think you are not understanding what i wrote in my lat post about my comments dont have so much of selfesteem,0
  you have two problems here first your coding skills are quite poor and second you are dismissing solutions from people far more knowledgeable than you are in order to improve your skills first you have to admit to yourself that you are not the best programmer ever and then start listening to what others are saying to you your solution is not proper solution it works but you will never get better programmer if you just stick to what just works without understanding what is going on in code take david heffernans answer and learn from it,0
the design of this unit is incorrect you can defend what youve done all you like but that doesnt make it any better heres the fundamental flaw the form cannot create itself as you did initially the global variable form1 is initialized outside the form when its created by the project file secondly  onshow is not where you initialize the form that should be done inside of oncreate onshow is called every time a showmodal occurs your code isnt calling showmodal its not even calling create which is when oncreate is called once self and form1 are referring to the same object,0
if you need to access tform1s methods via ttest method  then you need to inject tform1 into ttest somehow like via constructor injection the way youre doing it is completely wrong it might work but from an oodoop standpoint its wrong the whole approach is wrong anyway but youre not listening to anything any of us have to say in that respect yes its entirely possible to get an improperly designed bunch of classes to work so what you have not explained the role of ttest and nobody is sure what its for absent that all we can do is point out obvious flaws in the design,0
  believe me i understand what you did much better than you think there was no need to try and explain i understand why you had the problem in the first place i understand how you came up with your solution i understand why your solution is wrong and i know how to solve your problem correctly i will post an answer explaining all this to you in your comments youve said you want productive and useful answers if youre interested in learning please read my answer carefully,0
this is easy to achieve and sounds like homework where is your research effort please read how to askhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask and edit your question after show what you have tried so far and what your thoughts are to solve this problem,0
actually the biggest question is why dont you start with the basics as in put your code into a method it is possible to put to simply put a   block into your class directly this is called a initializer block but for a newbie most likely that is not what you want instead you want to study how java classes should be structured in general hint add a mainmethod then start writing few lines of code when you think this looks ok it should compile then run the compiler repeat instead of writing 20 30 lines of code  and then trying to isolate the syntax errors within,0

c and c are different languages unless youre specifically asking about differences between them dont tag both,0

it looks like you want us to write some code for you while many users are willing to produce code for a coder in distress they usually only help when the poster has already tried to solve the problem on their own a good way to demonstrate this effort is to include the code youve written so far example input if there is any the expected output and the output you actually get console output tracebacks etc the more detail you provide the more answers you are likely to receive check the faq and ask,0

welcome to stack overflow please take the tour have a look around and read through the help in particular how do i ask a good questionhelphowtoask,0
the right tool to solve such problems is your debugger you should step through your code linebyline before asking on stack overflow for more help please read how to debug small programs by eric lipperthttpsericlippertcom20140305howtodebugsmallprograms at a minimum you should edit your question to include a minimal complete and verifiablehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve example that reproduces your problem along with the observations you made in the debugger,0
what have you tried i dont see any effort here so is not a code writing service besides this type of functionality has been covered millions of times before,0
did you read the php reference manual  theres well documented methods for both dealing with comma separated strings and with type conversion,0
is this for an assignment or for fun  i ask because there may be simpler ways to do this than an array,0
welcome to stack overflow  please read the about and ask pages soon  also read about how to create an mcve how to create a minimal complete verifiable examplehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve aka an sscce short selfcontained correct examplehttpsscceorg  there seems to be a lot of code in the question,0
have you tried anything before posting it here ,0
you still refuse to add comments or otherwise improve your coding style or even just explain the purpose of your code,0
 it wont even help you because the post is still publicly visible in the edit history also mods will stop you eventually,0
your questions isnt clear and makes very little sense,0
this is not a link finding service google exists for that exact purpose this site is for programming questions please spend some time taking the tour and reading through the help pages before posting your next question here,0
the error message tells you exactly what is wrong and exactly what you need to do to fix it what more do you want from us the first thing you should learn is that the words in error messages contain meaning and that you need to read them in order to get that information,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because the error message already says exactly how to resolve the problem so its unclear what the issue is please also see why is “can someone help me” not an actual questionhttpmetastackoverflowcomq284236,0

this solution is simple readable and obvious,0
try to do some research before posting this is really a basic question,0
"this is a relatively basic question but the reason im downvoting it is because you have not provided enough information for anyone to give you an answer

to make the question appropriate you should at the least describe or provide the structure of the tables you want to query  in addition you may want to specify if you are querying using sql linq or some other accessor",0

downvoting because this answer is misleading described features of arraylist are found in the list too,0
hahah  i have problem what is answer,0
please consider searching the stackoverflow threads and other mediums before posting a question additionally make sure you post a question showing what you have tried,0
you mean like google,0
what do you want to know you have a method signature and an example call there is nothing more to be said about the code you posted,0
why am i garnering minuses on my question is it because people dont know the answer and want to take it out on the asker,0
codeinchaos how would you use this how is it useful how is it a method signature im used to seeing like public int testint a string b if it were like that it would make more sense,0
  and boltclock yes it is c if i put it into a solution it doesnt yell at me and even provides intellisense for the test method if indeed that is what it is as for compiling it nothing seems to happen it doesnt yell at me at the very least,0
that doesnt look like real sourcecode i cant think of a context where these two lines would compile if you claim that it compiles please post a compilable sample its just the method signature with an omitted body since documentation usually doesnt contain the method body,0
is this the full code sample,0
please post the link to the original doxygen example,0
not even the version you posted now compiles you cant have a method with no body inside a class,0
i ran it in vs2010 runs and compiles but does nothing,0
  doesnt compile for me,0
is this homework if not this is a remarkably bad method to do this operation,0
also if working fine means that the binary equivalent of 0xff is 1515 somethings wrong with my math skills,0
you should look in the forums first before posting questions that have been already answered,0

  9 out of ten persons who know c and qt if you tell them words signalslot will immediately associate this with typical qt pattern one will not i feel sorry for you,0
  also there are persons who by reading tags c qt would immediately associate this question as a qt specific as ive said i feel sorry for you,0
how are you applying the expression please post your code also please clarify what you mean with but none of them seemed to work what exactly does not work what is the result you get d only matches a single digit 09 matches the whole string if it contains at least on digit it appears you want d,0
wellstay cool  jcrowder sorry if im not as good as you i failed  ok can i,0
this question should probably have the homework tag,0
  and all that vote down thank you for your down votes now i cant ask more questionsi dont understand why you think this question will not help future visitors i tryed to find the answer to my problem and couldnt find any so here it is if someone have the same problem in the future here is the answer the knowledge is so vast that no one knows everything and sometimes its the little things we do not know that make all the difference,0
formatting your code and data sure makes a difference we put effort into our answers for you please put some effort into your questions for us,0
please have a look at the faqhttpstackoverflowcomfaq on how to ask a good question and also maybe read this what have you triedhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
yes there is a way but youll need to show your actual html and javascript that youre trying to do this with were not going to write it for you,0
can you show us how did you assign the id to your tag,0
this question shows a huge lack of effort both in researching and phrasing without actual code,0
you have to be more specific how do you want to send it do you have an established connection with the server what protocol can it be socet or has to webservice,0
i hope you arent making something sneaky  like a virus,0
1 since no efforts made to search answer,0
what fiddle where exactly is the problem,0
still looking for possible description or even solution to this cause i do need that clean file hierarchy by pip but with setuppy way,0
  in what way is this incorrect just because pip expects a setuppy it does not mean that pip does not provide any other behaviour,0
dude you answer is just plain wrong and downvoting my answer wont change that,0
  how is my answer wrong the reason op does not get exactly the same behaviour from setuppy as from pip is because they are not the same programme nor are they supposed to be whether or not he could use some combination of switches to achieve that is irrelevant,0
  are you trolling,0
  are you im answering the question that was asked,0
  that still does not make my answer misleading as you so charmingly put it,0
  by strict literalism yes you have correctly answered the question but the details are relevant its pretty clear that the op wants some understanding of why they behave differently or a way to modify the behaviour of one its like answering why do i perceive red differently from blue with because theyre different colours correct but useless,0
  where would we be if we constantly asked trivial questions different things are different if op wants to know about the implementation he is free to look at the source,0
  youre trolling arent you,0
  certainly not are you trolling you are the one who is defending a question that amounts to why are two distinct things not the same,0
  in neither case does the mechanism answer the why question it amounts to a restatement of the fact that the programmeeye works in a particular way you are essentially complaining that i didnt make up a question that like more and choose to answer that,0
  the very fact that you identify three possible topics shows that all that can be provided is general information of some kind so is not about making up your own better question and answering it,0
  so is not about providing unhelpful overlyliteral answers to provide useful information we often have to infer a better question the vote counts on these answers suggest other users think that providing some useful information is better than a literal but unhelpful answer,0
  bzzzt thats an ad hominem thanks for playing,0
  i dont have to there are plenty of comments already fyi ive also flagged that for moderator attention as not an answer you keep using so answers to boost your ego wo any benefit to the community you will get downvoted,0
its subtraction multiplication addition and square root kap which part of that do you need to know how to do,0
  youll never convince those flatearthers,0

we cant help you if you dont show what youve tried so far and what specific problems youre having,0
yes it is possible what have you tried google is your friend,0
people will only put effort into responses if you put effort into your question requests to write code your code will probably be ignored requests for help in a specific area or a specific sample would have a better chance of response,0
  considering his rep i think he just has not had his morning coffee yet,0
  oh dont judge people by their rep considering the code he have not a slightest idea what does his code do,0
this question isnt particularly well phrased  it took the comments on the answers to actually work out whats really being asked,0
i strongly suspect youve misdiagnosed the issue please show a short but complete program demonstrating the problem,0
your code the one you haven’t posted is almost comically wrong this is why it’s important that you post all the relevant code questions like this just waste everybody’s time,0
  i wonder how you can judge that is comical if you havent seen it if you dont know the answer to the question how to prevent optimization on a class field in c please feel free to not waste your time with it,0
what have you tried so farhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
this is a very generic description of your problem not an actual specific question please see httpblogstackoverflowcom201010askingbetterquestions and try googling on how to ask productive questions that we will love to answer,0
it helps if you include code showing people what you are trying to do or how its being applied otherwise it sounds like you want someone to write it for you,0
facepalm its help with the code im asking for i have not written any code yet with this omg,0
thats not code thats an explanation people are not here to write the code for you,0
youre pretty much asking people to write the whole program for you   try doing it step by step yourself and ask specific questions as specific technical challenges come up,0
no you will need to learn how to debug code besides this looks like a learning exercise so what good does it make to ask a broad fix my code question wheres the learning in that,0
but you havent said what the problem is should we guess what you need help with all you have done is posting a bunch of code without any description of your problem whatsoever you havent even said what sorting algorithm youre trying to implement,0
is this homework this is the third time ive seen this same question from different people in the past few days,0
stan why should anybody need to figure out your question ask the question and take your time to explain it be precisehttpwwwcatborgesrfaqssmartquestionshtmlbeprecise and explicithttpwwwcatborgesrfaqssmartquestionshtmlexplicit most people answering here wont copy your code and try to run it we read your problem description and run the code in our heads trying to see where things goes wrong,0
well why should i waste 2 hours searching for an answer so far the only similar questions were sorting words or using the sort method so why not,0
 ethis theres no meaningful difference between sorting numbers or words the algorithm would be the sameand there are tons of examples in many languages showing tons of algorithms the issue isnt however one of what youre trying to doits with the question itself,0
 ethis editing your two downvoted questions is likely hopeless id start over but heres the thingdont just say help me with the code describe precisely what isnt working what your expectations are in detail eg not just it should sort the numbersno shit youre writing a sort algorithm unless its a bogosort or random sort we assume you want them in some order and so on,0
1 comeon people this is no way to ask a question,0

please learn to use the search function on stack overflow this question has been asked many many times before,0
no one is going to write your code for you check out some jquery tutorials and read through the documentationhttpdocsjquerycommainpage and come back when you run into a specific issue or problem,0

very basic stuff 1 second google httpphpnetmanualenreservedvariablespostphp,0

to be honest you are all a bit quick to judge from the question alone there are valid applications where stuff like this is useful or even mandatory cashpoints school assignments kiosk apps in production lines ,0
   we were quick to judge because the question did not contain important relevant information  the phrase kiosk app would have prevented all the aggro  the point is that such apps as you mention are run on secure hardware often with special humaninterfaces eg keypads touchscreens not a standard pc keyboard  the desire of the op can certainly be met on xp anyway as anyone who has used a hotel lobby payperminute internet kiosk will know but im not sure how its done  its probably nontrivial,0
what exactly are you asking,0
  then next time dont tag java,0
did you just list every language you know,0
if you want a generic solution theres an language agnostic tag you should be using,0
have you tried it,0
did you try it and why not also even if it is valid syntactically it is not wise because of the semantics to use an int with the name π as you might have heard of it π is a mathemathical constant,0
not just code explain what youre trying to do in code next the problem,0
i dont know what you are doing with your edits here you have added a huge block of code and other information twice once before it got reopened and then you removed it and added it back recently,0

lovely idea but this is not how it works your reply is not an answer and shouldnt have been posted as one,0
  an altogether wrong answer is still an answer,0
completely incorrect answer,0
yeah this doesnt work produces an exact duplicate of the gif,0

is that a question,0
lucky im not a compiler,0
you dont need to write the type down but if you cant figure it out on your own that just means you dont actually know what your program does,0
this code does not do any validation,0
thats the answer i gave 3 hours ago when you asked,0
still shouldnt be used at it looks horrible and devs maintaining your markup in the future will think its okay to reuse if youve used it  and they may not style out its inherent ugliness in practice its to be avoided,0
personally id avoid the thickness as it looks chunky,0

this is your third question on a very similar theme if you were to give a better explanation of what you are trying to do eg why you want your data in an array not a dataframe then perhaps help would be more readily offered,0

what have your triedhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
what are you even trying to do could you explain clearly what html youve got what the user interaction is and what result you expect then well at least understand the question which is a start,0
you really need to show us your html and your javascriptjquery even if its not working show what youve tried link us to a demo at js fiddlehttpjsfiddlenet js binhttpjsbincom or similar please help us to help you,0
you need to clarify people suggest to use prototype instead of innerhtml where did you read this show the link as it is i can only guess the people mean using prototypejs library,0
you didnt know that link before you made your question and comment about people suggesting prototype so i think youre trolling,0

  its not really just a php thing its a working with relational databases thing and sort of a basic logic thing too  write out what you want your code to do verify that it makes sense and youre not adding a bunch of extra steps then write the actual code,0

how is this parallel at all thats totally sequential i dont know why op accepted this as an answer,0
i dont see any question neither any description of what youve tried so far voting to close the question as not a real question,0

if you got an answer that does not work unaccept that answer and talk to the people that are active in your question in order to get a working answer polluting the site with multiple identical questions is not the way to go,0
1 for not taking care of your own questionno formatting no explanation,0
dont you want to read an objectivec tutorial before writing an operating system in it,0
this has too much superfluous information in it,0
show your code its almost impossible to help if theres no context for these errors,0
sorry its still entirely unclear a what happens b what you expect to happen also the definition of myreturn may be helpful,0
its due to sloppy coding pure and simple take care when you code line up your braces watch your spelling compile often and fix all complilation errors before adding new code that will prevent these types of errors from happening,0
tbh that is not a good example of multithreading it only shows the technical side not how to use it properly multithreading is not instant win it wont magically accelerate your application,0
how about posting the code you have rather than the tutorial,0
please explain how this answers the question,0
any textbook or tutorial website should be able to do this,0
to closers sure the question might be boderline but its not really asking for code switch statements do confuse some due to the model being computed goto and not multiway selection but hey im biased as a i wrote an answer before the close vote was up ,0
  so if someone comes along can someone explain programming would you also jump in,0
op is talking of switches not switch statement or switch case even in a switch statement there is no plural of switch this is a bad and ambiguous question you can be as generous as you want i will close such question as i assume that even a so newbie can post better question and it is his duty op can come back and increase the quality but because people permaturely answer quality will not be increased and finally the question will get deleted as poor question is that generosity,0
modify how  what have you tried so far  anything,0
