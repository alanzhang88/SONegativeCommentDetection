Why should that code even work? You never call your register function. `Sometimes it work`  Bet that ***never*** works if that is the complete code,0
You'll learn a lot more if you do your own homework. I'd suggest starting by paying attention to formatting/indentation.,0

"No detail on what you want to achieve, no clear direction, you havent even tried to ask the right question.",0
"Probably because your question is short, shows no demonstration of effort, and seems to purposely discount the usual solutions that might be the best or only possibilities...",0

You should read a beginners programming book first. It seems like you do not understand the very basics of object oriented programming (or any programming) for that matter.,0

You're asking about general database scaling. Your questions range from entry-level to senior-dba level which is causing a lot of frustrating here. You're not going to learn 5+ years of experience in one question/answer environment. You've pointed out a lot of information that you've pieced together from the internet but it's clear you don't understand all the implications. Start slow and work your way from there.. don't ask ridiculous questions and learn when you're out of your league. That's the best thing you can take away from this question.,0
