an official tutorial is at httpdocsoraclecomjavasetutorialjavajavaoo ,1
an introductory tutorial on java would be a good place to start  interviewers can usually tell if youve never used the technology for which theyre interviewing before,1
maybe the hr just wanted to check your creativity applied to java language,1
i dont think there is a right answer for that,1
because 0 evaluates to false in boolean contexts,1
because 0 is falsey,1
for compatiblity with c 0 is implicitly convertible to false and nonzero is implicitly convertible to true,1
i is the same as i  0 in a boolean expression,1
use for int i  3 empty i to have infinite loop,1
or whiletrue cout  i    if you want to keep the while loop,1

indexofobject,1
how is this the opposite of get,1
suggest you read the javadocs for list httpsdocsoraclecomjavase8docsapijavautillisthtml  should be obvious,1
are you asking how to get index position of that element in your list,1
  with get you input the index and it outputs the object with indexof you input the object and it outputs the index,1
oh ok  in that sense,1
just for the sake of correctness if your objects start as  they are probably lists and not arrays,1
where did you get stuck with this,1
read up on zip and for loops,1
print each name with a number  enumerate,1
not sure how to print each name with each numbers from the lists for example the first name is test and the first number 1 is 5 then the first number2 is 20 i want that all on one line for each one in the lists,1
if you read how to ask a good questionhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask you may see that is asks you to create a mcve you should show your csv data how you read it into your lists then your expected output what does test 5 20 mean,1
test the name i said that already 5number1 20number2 all of which is inside the list from the csv file,1

yeah you missed the part where your statment question exlusivly refered to a singleton,1
the answer does not say such a thing private constructors are merely a way of enforcing the singleton pattern you only cheat it by having your main inside that class,1
making the constructor private is one of the things you need to do to implement the singleton pattern but its not the only thing and just this by itself does not automatically make it a singleton,1

the condition i  100 is false it should be i  100,1
  why,1
yes one person give the correct information so go with  ,1
  the loop executes as long as the condition is true i  100 is not true when the loop starts so it doesnt execute,1
  you have a backward understanding of how the condition works its not the test for when the loop should stop its the test for when the loop should keep repeating,1
the random numbers are irrelevant youd have the same problem with echo foo,1
  that makes more sense thanx,1
  i didnt understand because i asked this question yesterday linkhttpstackoverflowcomquestions40008544whycanthesecondforloopargumentnotbeequaltonumber4000858140008581 and was given a wrong answer i suppose,1

i am working on something similar are you going to store values per dom element or for the whole page as a total a simple implementation of color changing can be found here prodevsiteadmin click the logo to open the menu and from the settings you can quickly change page color perhaps creating a json settings file per user having the values of the colorsfont etc to store to database would be a good idea you could then pass the json to some javascript functions that will make the appropriate changes and complete the magic,1

why use a regex when sstrip does exactly this,1
sstrip only handles the initial white space but not whitespace discovered after removing other unwanted characters note that this will remove even the whitespace after the final leading n,1
someone downvoted this answer but didnt explain why it is flawed shame on you   if the down vote was you please reverse as i explained your question and you didnt mention anything actually broken with my answer,1
rafe you might want to doublecheck sstrip produces precisely the same result as your regex,1

you said numbers like what other forms should be accepted is 123 number valid or should it be 12300 is 1234500 valid or 01 do you want to accept only two decimal places or can it change,1
yes number u have mentioned are valid  ,1
update your post to include rules you use to decide what is valid and what is not,1
yes number u have mentioned are valid i also mentioned 1234500 which has four digits after  so can we assume that  can have any number of digits after it like 12345600 would such number be valid or there is some rule which invalidates it if so what rule is it,1
  123400 is not validmy current rule is i just want only one decimal value and accept commain text field,1
  only one digit and one comma,1

   multiple comma,1

i dont understand your question  please edit your question and instead show us sample input and output in tabular form each line indented by 4 spaces to format it as code,1
whats your question,1
i have a string  to  my address  and 3 values in a separate table i need to replace these value by key my first value is 10 so the first key get replaced with 10 10 to  my address  and such,1
please provide a small sample so we are clear on exactly what you mean appears like you can just split up the values and add them to the key but i would like a small sample to verify everything works as intended,1
what dialect of sql are you using  add a tag for that as well,1

where did the string come from it could be easier to check each character as the text comes in rather than all at once afterwords,1

it’s c use stdstring,1
  were you thinking about stdistreamiteratorchar and stdallof,1
note that c doesnt guarantee the character set that will be used,1
load the allowed characters as keys of an unorderedmap then query each candidate character if a char is not in the unorderedmap then an unallowed character is present and process accordingly,1

why are you using typeidname what exactly is it you want to achieve,1
code is tagc why the tagc tag,1
unclear what youre asking i also feel wrong with assigning a pointer to array,1
is it possible to define your own variable type and then use it as any other variable well thats one of the purposes of c,1
can you show the code that you would like to write as it stands the question is completely unclear,1
  thats initializating a char array from a string literal that does not exceed the size of the array not assignment it is valid,1
the whole point of struct is to define your own types so you are pretty much asking if you can define your own types without doing what is required to define your own type,1
what typeidaname returns is not defined by c it is down to the compiler writers it can be different for every compiler,1
you have it in my answer ,1
oh nice thanks,1
yeah i dont want to use stuct doesnt look good then use a language whose syntax suits you better aesthetically,1
  in c userdefined types are introduced with keyword class struct or union its unclear what you dont like about them and what youre actually trying to achieve if you explain better what doesnt look good means there might be a way to answer you,1
stdstring is a class just like your struct,1
heres a novel idea dont actually send the email until its ready to be sent just store it somewhere until its ready,1
ok i am not asking anybody to do my job just asking if there is anybody that has done something like what i am asking the reason i posted the question is because looking here httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysystemnetmailsmtpclientvvs110aspx there is no onsend or beforesend or something like that the smtpclient class only provides sendcompleted event,1
"youll need a way to intercept the message first how is the message being sent can you host a smart relay that does this do you need to program something new to do it or do any existing tools already perform this functionality there are lots of smart smtp servers out there

what exactly is the question again",1
  and joedm i just edited the question hope it is clear now,1
incidentally i assume that this is an email client you wrote or otherwise control the code of or are you trying to do an outlook plugin or something like that this is a very different question if youre trying to do this with a third party tool like outlook,1
also do you control the smtp servers,1
i have already done a plugin for outlook that does the same very big difference is that outlook object model do expose an itemsend event that allows me to cancel the sending operation i am trying to generalize the solutions to all mail clients that is why i ran into this and no i do not have any control on the smtp server,1

parameterized queries minimizes sql injection when cmdexecutenonquery executes  the injection often occurs when using concatenated values in a query string what exactly youve tried to do,1
try executing your command maybe something will happen,1
you form the command just fine but never execute it,1
like   suggested your code doesnt run the command which is why you get no errors becuase it doesnt actually do anything to return an error,1
  and how do i use that would be nice if you could help me,1
there is a typo in  ,1

"you could create an infinite loop package but ssis packages can be resource intensive if left to run forever

i would consider creating an agent job that runs every x secondsmins that checks for changes in the file and if there is a change to execute the package",1
you could try a script task that looks at the file systems info on the csv file you coudl count the rows in the csv file as a first step you coudl check the data against ids already held in your sql server table this is not a code problem as such its more that you are looking to learn ssis,1
please mention your table name or tried code,1

please be so kind and provide more information about your table structure,1
dontr spam tags c is a different language,1
youd find it easier and more maintainable to do this with structs,1
preferably trying to avoid structs and do it without them   ,1
  that is not valid c code anyway there is no position 1 or 0 the code is plain wrong,1
you really shouldnt be doing this but you can subtract the correct value from the char to get the right number like if you cast  char 0 to int then itll be a number specifically 48 so if you do int 048 youll get back a number,1
  avoiding structs solely for learning purposes  ,1

   cursor  collectionfindarraycategory filter 

   foreach cursor as document 
    valumongodbbsontojson document
    
    echo jsonencode valu

i got this response from php i want to create json object in android to use this json  ,1
in two cases youre returning a pointer that doesnt come from malloc,1
πάνταῥεῖ this question use method so this is c,1
you want to return null in case something went wrong and not a pointer to an unfreeable string literal like you do here return charmalloc,1
well to be fair im not doing anything with the return  charmalloc its just there for completeness it hangs after the very first call which returns the string succesfully but then hangs on freeidqueuestring,1
by the way this is very bad cast because you remove the read only attribute of char const ,1
why does it matter i only added that in the code for my question it actually returns null in my code and should never actually reach that address because i only use 5248 bits of ram out of 128kb,1
  you also have a code path that does returnstring  charempty i suggest you use a debugger to find your bugs,1
how am i not returning a pointer can you potentially tell me what its actually returning because it sure looks like a pointer returnstring to me,1
oh interesting i had a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of casting to char then what is a minimal way for doing the empty line i have it as a series of returnstringqueuelength  e  returnstringqueuelength  0 and that seems pretty cumbersome in terms of number of lines of code,1
also why did people vote my question down lol,1
doing strcpyreturnstring empty will copy the string literal to the char array you allocated that will fix a single problem you probably still need to take a careful look at the rest of your code,1
people vote your question down maybe because you dont provide a code that can reproduce you problem best to have mcvehttpsstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,1
  whats wrong with the rest of it sorry and yea im tired on a saturday night guess that was the obvious answer ,1
  im just being overly cautious based on this very small sample you might have similar issues elsewhere,1
"its the only function that returns a pointer ive monitor  memory and it remains static when external inputs are removed its in an electronics environment ive been able to predictably increase bit usage by stimulating the appropriate channels also i followed the entire program around through assembly and this was the only issue i encountered

why people have downvoted and voted to close my question is it not a valid question if someone has a misunderstanding of the language they use and make a mistake does that mean their question is worth removing so hostile",1
it has been already noted that you should provide a mcve your apparent reluctance to do so is likely the cause of down votes,1
the files required to compile for my embedded device number in the thousands i cant post that here,1
why would you expect it to return true,1
what number do you expect  or  to represent,1
also you should be using doubleparse or tryparse instead of converttodouble,1
whats the actual problem you are trying to solve here,1
i think this is a case for regex,1
you know the first character is x assuming these are always xy  z coordinates it should be simple to substring out the numeric information using indexof with substring or with a regularexpression,1
typing incompatible type cannot convert int to string on google would probably lead you to an answer if not reading some bookguidedoc would for sure,1
where exactly do you think this would happen why,1
i dont see anything wrong with this code can you post the whole console output,1
it doesnt give that error because the only int in that code the 3 in new string3 really does need to be an int no such conversion is needed,1
what you mean by int,1
this is not a number,1
its not integer  you cant,1
you really want to convert an image to int,1
you only want the numbers thats what you mean,1
if you want to convert part do split and convert,1

this is off topic it has nothing to do with the behavior of rand the latter is supposed to provide normally distributed set  of values any arithmetic operation on the result of it should provide a random result  is such an operation,1
its not off topic as it is in fact literally a portion of the problem at hand everybody is looking at rand without troubleshooting if modulomodulus  is a potential cause whilst you might recognize the flaw people who come across this topic who dont know what  actually does would have zero reference material to confirm themselves what the bug is i dont mind a 0 score but dont down vote my answer as irrelevant since it is relevant,1

you need to assign the input to a variable i assume scnextline returns a string so you need a string variable to assign that return value to,1

will you need to input a series of dance steps  that is will there ever be multiple lines giving d1 through dn,1
no it will always be one line the set of dance moves repeats supposedly infinitely many times,1
the output here will be 3 because there will always be people in spaces 1 2 and 3 no because with your current example the result is 3 after the first time the sequence is executed but becomes 2 after the second time the sequence is executed after that it stays constant at 2,1
say the order of the people before any execution is just 1 2 3 4 then after one execution according to the mapping above i think it should become 2 3 1 4 empty subsequently following the same mapping it becomes 3 1 4 2 empty and so on this is my understanding of the problem however the inputoutput above is provided spots 13 are always occupied,1
well first of all the numbers in your example input and your subsequent analysis dont line up but if i go with your example input lets say that initially theres one person on every position 1 1 1 1 after iteration one this becomes 1 2 1 0 after iteration two this becomes 2 2 0 0 subsequent iterations no longer change this result,1
yes sorry i just realized this and i have edited the question you are correct that for the example input the answer should have been 2 now updated to match analysis,1
same scenario for the new example input 1 1 1 1  2 1 1 0  3 1 0 0 then stabilizes,1
do the numbers represent the number of people on the corresponding index here if so it should be 1 1 1 1  1 1 2 0  2 1 1 0  1 1 2 0,1
are you talking about the result after every move or after every full sequence of moves,1
the full sequence of moves the last index in the example no longer be mapped after the first iteration since nobody is occupying that spot,1
then i dont see how you get to those results if we look at the execution of the steps in only the first sequence i have 1 1 1 1  0 1 2 1  0 1 2 1  2 1 0 1  2 1 1 0 so i dont see how you get to 1 1 2 0 after the first iteration,1
i am getting 1 1 1 1  1 1 2 0 each person is mapped to the corresponding index in 3 2 1 3 which means that the first index in 1 1 1 1 goes to index 3 the second one goes to index 2 and the third one goes to index 1 the last one also goes to index 3 since there is no 4 in the dancing moves array nothing is mapped to the last index in the array which means that it is at zero,1
think you missed a part in your assignment this means that they will move together for the rest of the remaining dances,1
hmm the example inputoutput i have currently in op is provided to me with output of 3 i believe that after arriving at 1 1 2 0 it follows 3 2 1 3 again the first index 1 is mapped to the 3rd index the second index also 1 is mapped to the second index the third index 2 is mapped to the first index since there is nobody at the last spot it cannot be mapped which gives 2 1 1 0 no matter how many times the people follow this set of dance moves the first three places remain occupied i think that all of the mappings be thought of as instantaneously occuring,1
hmmmm that changes things wouldnt the solution then just always be arraysstreammovesdistinctcount,1
a counterexample n  4 dancing moves  1 1 2 3 here the we would have the sequence 1 1 1 1  2 1 1 0  3 1 0 0  4 0 0 0 so the output would be 1 whereas the line of code outputs 3,1
i think that your idea of snapshotting might work what if every snapshot were stored into an array or something and once we get a snapshot that we have already arrived at we can conclude that it has stabilized it will begin to cycle then then we can count the number of nonzero elements and that should be the answer,1

dictionarystring liststring may work one key to a list value this wont look like your expected tho,1

would multiple savecontactmethodfoo be even valid json if that is what you want,1
   its a valid json but it produce warning warningduplicate key names should be unique,1
  i was thinking the same thing thats not valid json because you have duplicate property names,1
 balamanigandan so its not valid json then,1
   warning is different than error the said format is a valid json,1
does not work key value would never have duplicate key if you can have duplicate key use of keyvaluepair is meaning less,1
   yeah i need a better solution for this anyone please assist me,1
dictionarystring liststring would be what you need as initially mentioned,1
maybe you need to talk to your client and explain to them this is a stupid requirement likely to introduce all sorts of problems down the road,1
yes technically that is valid json however its meaning according to the spec is that preceding duplicate keys are ignored hence the warnings in your online tools the json is invalid if you care about the integrity of your data since you do care about the integrity you can no longer call it json its now your own custom format that happens to resemble json,1
   here the question is returning json with duplicate keys not for parsing first try to understand the requirement of the question then reply,1

theres nary a char in the code you show i for one have no idea what you are talking about why again is it surprising that a function with return type of int can return a value of type int,1
a is an int the function is returning an int would you still think a was a char if you changed its name to aaaaa,1
generally speaking arent az characters,1
isnt a also a variable in python,1
a is a char but a is not try return a or replacing int a with char a and see how far you get,1
 ưuvĩnhphúc what do you mean by that a can be used as a variable but by default a is not defined,1
  yes i mean it can be used as an identifier in python just like in c and it cant be a character in python,1
i mistakenly thought this was a meaningful question and voted to reopen i just took the ops assertion about the function and didnt read the code ,1
and it cant be a character in python  yes it can a is perfectly valid python expression,1
  of course its a valid python express just like its a valid c expression because its a valid identifier but its not a valid character string how do you print a and expecting it to print the letter a to console without setting a  a first,1

you do not have a return 0 statement at the end of main  how is main going to return anything without a return statement,1
nonvoid functions must return something,1
  main has an implicit return 0,1
  in c main will implicitly return 0 if no return statement is encountered its a rule unique to main,1
the programm compiles with no errors  but i bet you had warnings about returning nothing from a function that is supposed to return something like your setweaponname function  the code asis invokes undefined behavior due to this issue,1
  while true by pointing that out to a novice programmer you are encouraging sloppy programming  if the desire is for a value to be returned it should be explicitly done and not rely on implicit behavior  implicit behavior can come later when the program actually works,1
i put return 0 on main and a return to the other fuctions but i have still the same problem,1
  bs theres nothing sloppy about omitting a return 0 from main if you actually write return 0  id have to ask if you knew what you were doing you are actually confusing a new comer by implying main needs an explicit return statement and that their code is faulty for not having it,1
once i clean up all of the setter functions that return nothing by replacing the return type with void i get a tonne of errors good odds that all of the invalid functions confused the heck out of the  compiler and produced a completely batsmurf program,1
put return 0 on main and a return to the other functions but i have still the same problem  without changing what i mentioned those problems will remain,1
  its a necessary requirement for the homework to put setters and getters,1
just remember that there is almost never a reason for a setter function to have to return anything,1
whole bunch of free functionshttpsstackoverflowcomquestions4861914whatisthemeaningofthetermfreefunctioninc accessing private class members you cant do that,1
  well its silly you should ask whoever set those requirements and see if they come back with something better than the usual its good practice nonsense,1
recommendation dont write so much code at a time write a few lines maybe a function then compile if you have enough to test test it but do not proceed until you have no compiler errors no compiler errors and your testing finds no bugs if you let any of these build up they tend to interact with one another making it harder to sort out whats a real bug and whats an artifact of another bug,1
what do you mean by returns 3221225477 the program prints that thats the exit code i notice 3221225477 is 0xc0000005  that might mean something,1
here is a working code  cppsh46j35 the main and only problem was with your setters return type should be void  i have no idea why that even compiled,1
tactical point expanding on   s comment if a variable has a getter and a setter and the setter does nothing to protect the variable from someone injecting a bad value you might as well make the variable public and remove the setter and getter setters are all about the object protecting itself if its not protecting itself the setter is just more code that can have a bug in it,1
  i didnt write all in once but khow i put the duelforyoungsamurais or the pickweapon parts in comment and i have the same problem,1

somehow that mass of nonreturning functions that should be returning  successfully hides a raft of coding mistakes that are errors in gcc 485 and 492 no idea how,1

heres something i didnt see earlier  friend string duelforyoungsamuraissamurai a samurai b but duelforyoungsamurais is defined as void duelforyoungsamuraissamurai a samurai b since the return types are different they arent the same function so  the implementation of duelforyoungsamurais cannot access the private members,1
  the code contains no pointers no arrays no calls to new etc  so the only thing i can see that would cause it to not work is and this is the third time mentioning this  your functions that are marked as returning string that fail to return a string are the most likely cause for the errors  playing around commenting out things is not going to fix that problem  either make those functions void or return a string,1

look up arraymap in the php manual,1
sigh is 15843 a string or an array are you wanting to convert it to the string 15843 or an array containing 1 5 8 4 3,1
  15849 is a string and i wanting it to the string 15843,1

i am downvoting this because the question doesnt include any code showing the problem among other reasons,1
im still willing to help,1
  thank you its an assignment  also im not allowed to use structures or classes for the program,1
  code is in the link to the paste bin what other reasons,1
"i cleaned up the formatting a bit including for the code  follow the pattern for indenting that i used in main to make the code more readable  that might help remove some of these down votes  

now if im understanding correctly are you looking to print the age of every reservation for a given sport",1
  yes so if a user enters the char f for flying all the reservations that fall under that category within the sporttypeindex of char f would be printed out with their corresponding ages so if a patron age 18 who entered f was in the array it would print a patron aged 18 reserved a session of flying,1
  the main reason we would like all information pertinent to the question in the question is so that the question can stand the test of time if the information is stored at another site it can rothttpsenwikipediaorgwikilinkrot and this question will be rendered useless to people with the same or similar problems in the future a common second reason is we dont know what nasty things may be lurking at an off site link and may not be interested in finding out the hard way one evil flash banner can ruin your whole day,1
off topic editing the code i notice many functions claim to return a value eg int inputageint patronage int index but do not contain a return statement this will lead to no small amount of grief it is syntactically valid but is logically undefined and the compiler can do absolutely nothing or generate whatever code it wishes including seemingly correct code to do something your compiler should be warning you about this,1
thanks for the edits of the code      it sounds like what you want to do is search the array of sports for all indices that contain a particular value  in other words loop through sporttype and capture every index that leads to a certain character,1
  thanks for the heads up i will post the code directly in the future should i alter the functions to return instead of setting them equal in the inputnewreservation function my compiler didnt give me any warnings so i didnt realize this would impact my program operation,1
  so syntatically am i looking at something along the lines of a for loop that goes int i  0 i  size i  if sporttypeindex  insert char here print out message  with size being a counter variable that i set in main to increment each time a new reservation and thus an indices of the array is set,1
you have it recommend generalizing the function a bit and passing in insert char here and a string containing a longer description of the sport as parameters that way you only have to write one function for all sports,1
and dont forget to post the final code here so that others can find it in the future,1
compiler warnings sometimes need to be enabled in visual studio open the properties and navigate configuration properties ccgeneral and play with the warning level in gcc add a wall to the command line or play with the gui of whatever ide youre using to set the command line for you youll have to look that up yourself because there are dozens of them,1
and part three in inputreservation the line sporttypeindex  inputtypesporttype index counts on inputtype returning the correct value so currently the code blows itself up by not returning ideologically a function should do only one thing so input should just take input and hand that input off to someone who knows how best to store it the simpler a function is the easier it is to debug so char inputtypechar sporttype int index should probably be char inputtype read the user input into a temporary value test the value and return the value when its good,1
  i edited with my current revisions my program is currently running as far as letting the user enter the desired reservation type and patron age but is not printing anything when the user enters 2 i will revise again with the changes you suggested about changing the functions,1
the short answer is you have no print statement in the function that handles option 2 youll learn a lot more figuring out what the print statement has to look like than you will from being fed a canned answer so im going to walk away at this point,1
  alright well thanks for your help,1

then which time zone do you want to format in,1
neither timezone is unknown,1
then date isnt what you want as that represents an instant in time which only has a local yearmonthdayhourminutesecond when you apply a time zone the same instant has different values in different time zones and they dont make sense without a time zone its like asking for the binary encoding of a string without specifying an encoding,1
  no date represents measure of time it can mean one instant in one timezone and another instant in another,1
  no its like asking a distance without specifying an origin we have double type which holds this nobody requires to provide units of measurement and origin for doubles the same should be for datetime,1
  no it really doesnt date is an instant in time  a number of milliseconds since the unix epoch its not since some arbitrary point in time  it has a wellspecified origin the longer you fight against this the longer you will have problems please accept it if you dont believe me you should read the javautildate documentation which starts the class date represents a specific instant in time with millisecond precision,1
your code is correct you are also correct that it depends on your jvms time zone and for the same date object will produce differnt results in different time zones exactly therefore you need to specify for which time zone you want the result,1
if all you have is a point in absolute time relative to unix timestamp there is no way to format it without a time zone because that will display as a different time in different time zones  where and in what format does your value come from,1
  suppose it is in shire,1
  what are you saying does imply utc,1
  if you have a timezone you can specify that timezone and you wont have a problem,1
  i have no timezone i have hhmmss from third party source its timezone if unknown and may mean different instant than one i get if parse this string,1
  see my very simple example code showing that date is not instant,1
  it not only format matter you can also call gethours getter and see the same date is just not an instance if you use its components in any way and you use it in numerous cases for example if you read date from database server by clients all over the world you will get the same components but different gettime,1
iow you dont have an absolute time  you want httpsdocsoraclecomjavase8docsapijavatimelocaltimehtml,1
your tests dont show what you seem to think it shows youre parsing it in the system default time zone and constructing 19700101t000001 in the system default time zone however im done here youre ignoring both what the documentation says and what someone with considerably experience in datetime work says youre welcome to do that of course but youre not going to make any progress you should follow slaks advice and use localtime as thats what the value youre receiving represents it doesnt represent an unambiguous instant in time,1
  and you are ignoring how date is used in numerous libraries and tools i am done here too,1
  i dont want absolute time i want relative time,1
then you want localtime or localdatetime as thats precisely what they model,1
a date only contains an instant whether it contains a correct instance well if it contains an incorrect one it certainly wouldn’t be the first time in you socalled proof it contains an instant of 2 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds before the epoch — which in turn tells me you jvm’s time zone is at an offset of 3 hours from utc,1
dims i believe the real answer to your question is stay away from javautildate it confuses you and there’s no reason why you should want that use the newer classes in javatime instead like those   mentions,1
i dont want absolute time i want relative time i think what you are looking for is duration or period from javatime even so numerous libraries and tools use date doesnt mean its correct,1
 öhrl that depends on relative to what if relative to a time zone jon skeet’s suggestion is better if relative between two points in time you are entirely correct,1
 öhrl i agree it is not correct this is my point and it is not an instant but it is dual second nature of date appears not in formatting only but in many cases,1
 v absolutely just wanted to throw those into the field as they havent mentioned yet  dims this simply shows that time is a very complex field jon skeet is an expert there trust him,1
i agree in your view that the date class was designed with a “second nature” i just meant to say the state a date object holds is an instant only the second nature is in constructors the methods particularly the many deprecated methods but also in tostring this design is generally considered poor in retrospect and is one of the reasons new classes were designed twice first calendar and later all the javatime classes,1
  assume you have a date object created by expression new date601000 what is the expected string you want to generate from this,1
 v according to oop paradigm the internals of object is black box the true nature of object  is what you can get from it or set to it by its methods you cant say that some of methods are true and another methods are false the matter of fact is that date class has two contracts regardless the number of downvotes and regardless documentation there are a lot of libraries that read datetime and present it in date format for java in this moment the contract of number of milliseconds from unix era is violated,1
  in my situation i am receiving date time from another source and it is constructed from parts and i need to print exactly these parts your case is irrelevant,1
  if the date is constructed from say year month day in month hrs and min and you cannot guess the time zone used when constructing it there is no way you can fulfil the requirement of printing those parts from the date,1
  ok assume you have a date object created by expression new date70 0 1 0 1 0 what is the expected string you want to generate from this,1
  something like 19700101 000100 order should depend on format but components should be kept,1
 v please understand that timezone should not be part of date because date should measure time while timezone is a measure for space we are not storing kilograms meters and so on units in double and whe should not keep timezone in date,1
your update 4 only proves that gethours reflects the local time zone which you are changing  if one repeatedly evaluates ab and gets different sums when changing b that doesnt mean that a is also changing,1
  but this means that ab contains also b but not only a,1
contains is the wrong word but sure ab is dependent on both a and b in the same way that the hour returned from gethours is dependent on both the instant held by the date object and the local time zone  that does not mean that the instant changes when you change the time zone no more than it means that a changes when you change b,1
also you say in the sample hours property  however dategethours is a method not a property  java doesnt have properties in the same way that c has it only has methodshttpstackoverflowcoma2963249634824  a method that takes as input some outside information cannot be described as purehttpstackoverflowcoma22395430634824  therefore what you are observing is simply that the gethours method is impure because it takes the system time zone as one of its inputs,1
"  expression ab namely contains b you may say depends on but you cant say contains is wrong 

i never said instant changes i only said date contains not only instant and this is true date is the same as ab in your excellent example where a is an instant and b is timezone

in terms of java bean convention gethours is a property getter for property hours i may rewrite access to this property with any bean library the fact that getters in java do not have additional brace level changes nothing

of course you may say gethours is impure",1
i believe that it is finally clear what the problem is here if class a has a method getdata and this getdata method is returning a internal state which is an instant modified by some external value lets skip the timezone lets say its users screen resolution does this make a an instant or not and does this imply that a stores screen resolution or not  i believe that this is simply semantics thing  how you define what is an instant it seems that most people define instant differently from the questions author,1
  i understand instant as a point on time dimension i dont deny date contains instant i deny it is an instant we may say it is impure instant if you wish the very fact that date has so much depreated methods and that there are so many alternative implementations alone proves that javautildate is both impure and bad design,1
ok i understand what you mean  but can you refer to the example with screen resolution if the class with a private instant field would have a getdata method which would return value based on local screen resolution or any other environmental data would that mean that it is not instant just want to make sure that i get your instant definition right i believe that a game changer here would be to provide a definition of an instant from some trustful source because the discussion is about instants and nobody posted any definition yet,1
  it depends on whether it is possible to reach instant pure if the class would have only getdata which returns only instant dirtied with screen resolution i would say either it is not instant or some special sort of instant defined by class designer i am opened to any definition but it should not drift,1

trying to configure displaystartuperrors at runtime might not make the most sense though manual lists it as phpiniall changeable  but i think we are past the “startup sequence” at this point,1

  the sense is to make the application display errors if i check the development checkbox at login form if i dont check the session var will be null so errors display will be 0,1
what you want to achieve with this is clear but i doubt trying to set displaystartuperrors at this point makes any sense  we are probably a bit beyond the php “startup sequence” as the manual calls it as this point,1

start by learning to use vim without your mouse,1
force yourself not to use the mouse you will learn vims navigation shortcuts better that way also vim is designed to be inefficient youre supposed to glue together lots of strange tricks to navigate files this glueing of slow commands means vim is more configurable but harder to use than a modern editor,1
what do you mean am i using a i use i to go into insert how do i use vim without the mouse,1
well i starts the insertion before the cursor and a starts the insertion after the cursor this cheat sheethttpsvimrtorrcom might be handy,1

  i somewhat disagree vim is a tool used primarily for programming which disqualifies the offtopic close reason general usage,1

try httpsvimadventurescom   for learning vim  learn to not touch your mouse or any arrow keys,1
did you use vimtutor to start it sounds like you skipped that thirty minute intro,1
  vim is not designed to be inefficient the opposite is true its designed in a very different way then most editors to be more efficient,1
vim is a text editor not a code editor its designed to glue small commands together to do simple navigation like 10j wordcr tf etc which are composable for doing large repetitive tasks but intentionally inefficient for day to day navigating,1

printfthe sum of the numbers are d sum  printfthe sum of the numbers are d sum,1
why are you printing the variable address ,1
with d you should use the variable itself not the pointer in this way youre printing sums address,1
need to use n for cleaner output,1
alsothere is no need to do this in a loop sum of 1 to x is sum  x12,1
which compiler are you using gcc and clang both emit a warning format ‘d’ expects argument of type ‘int’ but argument 2 has type ‘int ’,1

you can use a debugger to find out whats going on,1
try put the cin instruction in the loop to let the user a chance to update the commandinput value on each loop,1
of course it runs infinitely the contents of the loop keep checking the same variables hoping that their values would somehow magically change on their own of course c doesnt work this way theres nothing inside the while loop that will change the values in the variables as such each iteration of the loop will always come up with the same results,1
have you tried stepping through the code using a debugger,1
commandinput  invreport this is not how you compare two strings,1

sounds like you have some nonvisible or hidden null bytes in your code similar to the behavior in this question python source code string cannot contain null byteshttpsstackoverflowcomquestions31233777pythonsourcecodestringcannotcontainnullbytes but of course on windows you might want to try copying the text from idle into another text editor that can view hiddennonascii encoding inspect for and remove any unusual characters then paste the cleaned text back into idle and try running the code again my guess something near that grey block between the print and x,1
also you could press edithttpsstackoverflowcomposts45065685edit on your question and copypaste the code into your question and let us view the text to check for hidden characters,1

dont know how on visual studio,1
as in maximum temperature,1
   dont know how on visual studio  so you didnt see debug in the main window of visual studio and wondered what it does  or hit f10 on a successful build of your program,1
  using a debugger is an essential skill for any programmer its very easy with visual studio a quick google search will give you tons of resources to guide you,1
  visual studio has integrated debugger search for online tutorials on how to use it,1
guys there is no error copy the code and use it to see my problemhttpsstackoverflowcomusers7359094franc3a7oisandrieux,1
google how to debug small programs read and implement,1
   you mean there are no compilation errors not runtime or logic errors  just because your program compiles without any syntax errors doesnt mean your program is free of bugs  also some advice  instead of 24 number try instead something much smaller like 5 numbers  that way it will be much easier for you to see where your program goes wrong,1
dude there is not a single error there is no errors i used the debugger and the compiler and there is no error,1
what else   ,1
  debugger doesnt show errors on its own you are supposed to step through your program while watching the values of the variables to figure out where the code functionality deviates from your expectations,1
if you had stepped through with your debugger and used a smaller easiertofollow top limit as suggested much earlier by   your would have spotted many errors,1
you have many many errors that you should have seen when running under your debugger,1
do note that void main is an error  main must return a int,1

edit your question and insert your code there its not readable in a comment,1
what do you mean by not working what tests did you run whats the output,1
javascript  java,1
whats your main method looks like add input and expected output,1
im going to guess in your main method you created a vendingmachine with 20 cans or 10 cans and add10 cans then inserttokenx2 theres your output,1
its because of machineadd10 either delete it or rewrite your expected count,1
why do you expect tokencount to be 0 in first place,1
"here is my teachers requirement for the codeprovide two constructors for the vendingmachine class
1 a default constructor vendingmachine that initializes the vending machine with
10 soda cans
2 a constructor vendingmachineint cans that initializes the vending machine
with the given number of cans
both constructors should initialize the token count to 0",1
it does what its supposed to do,1
im just trying to figure out what correction should i make in order to let the token count to be 0,1
in what scenario if youre trying to simulate a vending machine i guess each can should have a price and then when you insert tokens it accumulates them until it reached that price then youd zeroize the tokens number is that what youre trying to do,1
put pdbtrace before that line and try to print weight from that console,1
remove weight  global weight weight is already a global variable,1
  wait does weight  global weight not give you a syntax error it does for me both in py 2 and in py 3 so i dont think thats their real code,1
  it does there is more than one reason to remove that line,1
op please show us the real code the code that you included has a syntax error and there is no need to include those verbose user instructions,1
i removed the line you guys told me to but now it still tells me that weight isnt defined when i asked the user for it at the beginning of the program i really appreciate the help,1
i updated the original post with the code i currently have along with the functions,1
this programming language claims my is never a good start to a question never  99999999999999 of the time it is correct and it is very unlikely you found a bug in the language,1
please give us the exact error message full traceback not just python is telling me that weight isnt defined,1
please try to make a minimal code which actually shows the error ie i can run it and get the same error you are having it looks like you removed the part which is the actual cause of the problem but you dont know it for example an assignment to weight after the line with error and show the exact exception you are getting,1

lists arent considered string objects but   is so     is concatenating a string to the lists,1

please edit that into the question,1
what are these interspersed primaryg nsup and what are they supposed to tell us,1
and if that means primaryg is nsup… well then it is a string youre trying to concat with a list,1
those are just output from my print statements,1
"printprimaryp primaryp
    printprimaryg primaryg
    printprimaryain primaryain
    printprimaryaout primaryaout
    printprimarydin primarydin

it works if i only concatenate first two lists problem starts from third list onwards csrpgprimaryprimaryp  primaryg  works fine,1
at least one of the things you think is a list is not a list presumably everything that outputs as  instead of ,1
thats the bit im not able to understand i agree with you that first two elements im trying to addprimarypprimaryg dont look like list but more like strings however all six things im trying to add i declared them as lists and for firs two im just appending strings to them for eg primarypappendportname  where portname is a string now my understanding is even though portname is string now it has been added to a primarp list why it is giving an error when im trying to add primaryp to a bigger list csrpgprimary,1
hope i made the question clear code is so big that i dont want to post here and add confusion but my basic question is astringa a bxyzbiglist aappenda now if i do biglistab shouldnt that work,1
the problem is with 99999 certainty that somewhere in your “big code” you’re replacing the list with a string not appending to it,1

thats what ive said c is a superset of c that means a c code is also a c code but a c code is not always a c code,1
no c is not a strict superset of c just like the link i gave you says,1
thanks for the link i didnt know that not much of a c guy myself community driven qa mailing list etc brings out a primitive being wise syndrome i guess ,1
no c definitely wont always compile as c the first example i can think of is int foo  mallocsizeofint,1
no there are a nontrivial number of legal c programs that are not legal c programs anything involving vlas implicit conversions of void  to other pointer types any code that uses c keywords such as class or new as identifiers etc and that gap gets wider with each new language version  c and c are two completely different languages that share a large subset of syntax but then so do oberon and pascal,1

vbx you dont use any signalsslots connection am i missing something,1
  signals and slots are qt specific constructs what vbx gives you here is the standard c solution,1
  i see that but my question is qt specific i thought the notion of signal slot would be a good give away also if you would note i dont ask how to use try catch block,1
  your question is in no way qt specific qt is c it may have special macros and its own special little precompiler and build projects but its still c the fact that you happen to use signals changes nothing about exception handling,1
  the question is very qt specific count will be called asynchronously so knowning where the exception is handled is not as easy as it seems,1
  can you explain that a little generally parameters to a function are fully evaluated before the function is called how does the slot macro make it asynchronous,1
this is a string not a function call slotcount  1slot or maybe 2slot im not sure,1

so the  is the problem ,1
  exactly it seems you have colons in other ids also youve to remove all of them to get the page work,1
ok i will do that thanks so much for helping,1
haskells type classes are not a form of objectorientation they are a form of adhoc polymorphism which you typically also get from object systems but they do not couple data and methods which is the hallmark of objectorientation,1
  they do in fact couple data and methods  the type of the data determines which function or which part of the function definition if you want to view it that way is called,1
that couples the type of the data and methods httpwwwhaskellorghaskellwikioopvstypeclasses,1
  is right haskell typeclasses are much closer to oop interfaces than oop classes but even that analogy isnt perfect in fact the closest thing to oop classes in haskell are simply data types containing functions and monadic actionshttpwwwhaskellorghaskellwikifaqi27mmakinganrpgshouldidefineatypeforeachkindofmonster2candatypeclassforthem3f,1
  yes and that is characteristic of object oriented languages only a minority associate operations with instances at all in even fewer can that be described as the normal operation of the oo system,1
  i dont think this is true although it is an acceptable lie to children  if you dont think about the constraint system typeclasses are just a slightly restricted object system  in that typeclasses have 1 subtyping 2 implicit self reference 3 replaceable self reference aka inheritance  a typeclass is just a parameterized abstract class in oop while an instance is just an object that inherits from that abstract class  with ghc 74 and some trickery involving newtype unsafecoerce and implicit parameters this correspondence becomes complete,1
i also think that couple data and methods is really independent from oo  consider go as the example of a language where methods are separate from structs yet it is very oop,1
on the other hand the naive view that typeclasses are equivalent to interfaces and that datatypes in haskell are equivalent to classes in oop that implement those interfaces is just wrong  the typeclass system is a layer used for defining classes in the mathematical sense aka predicates over haskell types  it just happens to be an object oriented layer to for defining predicates over haskell types,1
  my answer in no way relies on oo being able to do everything that haskell type classes can do it relies on the haskell type class system being able to do everything that oo can,1
  dont know why im responding to this nonsense but typeclasses dont have subtyping dont have implicit self reference and dont have inheritance the haskells overlooked object system paper has a good discussion of why typeclasses dont do the job and hence what it proposes instead and i think the ohaskell paper also motivate the differences quite well anyway implicit parameters are not idiomatic haskell these days and unlikely to make it into a standard and once you start to involve unsafecoerce then youre clearly off the reservation,1
  im not sure what either of those papers have to do with my claim  the class per class encoding is clumsy i agree my point is more subtle  typeclasses in haskell are classes over types  we are all constructivist here so for us to suppose a type is a member of a typeclass requires some sort of evidence object  further the language provides an automatic theorem proving system in the form of inference and global instances  my claim is only that the proof language for this logic is oo and it is helpful for reasoning about haskell to be aware of this fact,1
the evidence type for membership in ord is a subtype of the evidence type for membership in eq  implicit this references and inheritance are what let you declare m  k  m    k in the definition of monad  to simulate this behavior with records requires finding a fixpoint as pointed out by oleg which should clue you in something is up  the reason this shouldnt be surprising is that typeclasses sit on the otherside of the expresion problem from abstract data types  from william cooks work we know that means they are probably objects,1
obviously this object system is a restricted one but you just need to look at bruno oliveiras work to know that is a nonessential aspect see scalas implicits  my point about unsafecoerce is that with some extensions and unsafe features you can actually get your hands on the objects that bare witness to typeclass membership   and using implicit parameters you can construct arbitrary such instances at runtime although it relies on the compiler not obeying its documentation,1
  the evidence type for membership in ord dictionary i suppose you mean isnt a subtype of the evidence type for membership in eq its just that ord membership implies eq membership an ord instance cant override eq methods i have no idea what youre getting at with the monad example  yes if you encode monads with objects then the encoding is objecty but thats because you chose an objecty encoding to begin with anyway this evidence type doesnt always exist other implementations of haskell such as jhc show you can go very far without a dictionary encoding,1
  a proof of membership in ord is a proof of membership in eq  is a is the same thing as subtype  the monad example is about inheritance not subtyping they are separate since unless a monad instance overrides the default definition of  it inherits a general one but this general one uses  which is defined virtually  this is what i was talking about in terms of implicit this parameter and inheritance   the point that you dont have direct access to this object system and that it isnt always implemented directly doesnt really matter  it explains the semantics,1
but you can explain the semantics without an object system too does the fact that i can explain counting with pebbles mean that naturals are a kind of collection of pebbles,1
  an object system is anything that meets certain criteria you cannot say the same of a collection of pebbles,1
that is a good point  i find that thinking about typeclasses as objects plus a prolog like theorem prover where every rule begins with a cute makes it easier to reason about something rather complicated and gives me access to a body of literatures and design principles that apply to my problem  thinking about c templates as a functional language sort of like haskell makes them easier to reason about also  i generally try to understand the weird edges of mathematical systems by describing them in terms of axioms i already know  you dont need ring theory to explain integers,1
i want to send the listint through tcp and ive already get the server and client connected now i need send the listint data from client to server i know the method send is based on char or char i dont know how to deal with listint thank you very much,1
you can turn the list of integers into a single string and parse it out on the other side,1
how many integers do you have it could be good enough to convert int to string snprintf fe and send each one with send,1
i have 25 different values i have to send the value one by one to the server which method should i use to convert it to string,1

wow really never thought about this,1
  you should change the title of your question to reflect your last comment whats the difference between pip and setuppy isnt much of a question it seems like youre actually interested in something a bit more specific,1
sure thanks a lot,1
  if you want the behaviour of pip use pip,1
thats somewhat misleading though  pip does use setuppy im sure if you get the right options or possibly use a wrapper script its possible to get the same results with setuppy,1
this is incorrect in most cases pip does download the package from pypi unzip it and run the setuppy script albeit with some extra options if you try to have pip install from a tarball for example without a setuppy youll get an error saying so,1
  sure but thats not the question  the question is why the one does not give identical results to the other,1
  obviously theyre not the same program they have different names but your answer fails to highlight the connection one calls the other or explain how to get setuppy to do what the op wants so its technically correct but not useful   has provided what the op was almost certainly looking for,1
  implying that theyre entirely separate when pip calls setuppy is misleading,1
  not really pip probably also uses list but it doesnt follow that they are connected the question does not ask how can i reimplement pip myself,1
  in the context of installing a package pip and setuppy are clearly connected,1
  they may be connected but the question doesnt ask are they connected  it asks why they dont have the exact same behaviour and the answer is because they are not supposed to thats all there is to it how they achieve those effects is not relevant,1
  what other answer is there there is no reason whatsoever to expect them to have the same behaviour you might as well complain that i havent dumped the whole code for pip in my answer,1
  of course you can expect them to have similar behaviour they both serve to install a python package its different behaviour that needs explanation as for another answer  s answer is a good start  providing a single option to setuppy makes it behave like pip thats relevant and likely useful,1
  why does different behaviour need explanation pip does not advertise that it provides identical behaviour nor vice versa in so far as they are supposed to be similar they are similar they install a python package to expect a different explanation is like asking why you and i dont use the same writing style neither of us has indicated that we would,1
  different behaviour requires explanation because the question is about the difference in behaviour where would humanity be if we never asked how or why,1
  almost all code questions could be answered by reading enough source but asking can give more useful information more quickly re different things see redblue example above,1
  the reason why you dont perceive blue and red as exactly the same thing is because they are not exactly the same thing there is no deeper explanation than that if you want to inquire into the mechanisms of perception that is a different question,1
  in both the ops question and my redblue example saying because theyre different does not convey any information that the asker did not already know assuming the question is posed in order to gain information an answer that does not provide information has no value a useful answer to the ops question might discuss how the difference is implemented or why developers chose different mechanisms for the redblue conundrum a useful answer might cover wavelengths of light pigments and colour receptors in the eye,1
  the details of the way that the programmeeye works can be informative and interesting given that the question is asked to gain information if the literal answer to the question contains no information we can infer that we have misunderstood what the asker wants in that case we can attempt to infer the question they meant to ask and provide useful information this process does not always work perfectly but its better than an answer with no information,1
  you may doubt your powers of comprehension but i am confident in my own when someone asks a nonsensical question i assume they dont know that what they are asking is nonsensical rather than inferring that it is an oblique way of soliciting a general disquisition on the topics mentioned in that case informing them that their question is nonsensical is new information,1
  no the question can be clearly understood to have a rational answer more specific than a general discussion possible readings are how can i make them behave in the same way which vartec answered how do they achieve different results similar or why did the developers choose different mechanisms we can presume the pip developers were aware of the other mechanism,1
  leave the votes of others out of it  you are still arguing that i should make up a new question if you want this to be a different question go ahead and edit it,1
  the votes of others became relevant when the discussion moved to what so is about in as much as so is a community what it is about is determined by the opinions of its members,1
  well if you really want to argue about that it turns out that so users dont have to leave a reasoned explanation for their downvotes for example i am getting a bunch of downvotes on old questions which i assume come from you for obvious reasons and vartec whenever he sees my handle he is reminded that i once pointed out an error in one of his answers so no they dont really convey much information,1
  i have not gone back to downvote your other answers and i do not intend to,1
  perhaps vartec is feeling extra insecure today,1
  no its not an ad hominem look it up otoh your comment is a childish attempt to provide an excuse to withdraw from the discussion,1
i will downvote any answer that is clearly wrong   if you can name any of your correct answers that ive allegedly downvoted dont be shy mention it,1
  you know that i cant tell who is downvoting my answers especially as you never leave comments one presumes that is because you have no valid criticisms,1
  he means his great answers like httpstackoverflowcomquestions10129080analysisanddesignforfunctionalprogramming1012917210129172,1
  i note that you havent left a comment on that i defy you to locate any inaccuracies in that answer,1
im not going to try to arbitrate on other answers withdrawing from the discussion on the other hand sounds like an excellent idea   good luck trying to argue the case for this answer,1
  theres no case to be argued you have spent several hours complaining that i have provided an answer to the question asked not to your preferred question you could complain about every other question on so on that basis,1
  any fyi your revenge downvotes will get revoked,1
  just because you string some words together it doesnt follow that they make sense youre the one whose fragile ego has lead you to engage in a campaign of downvoting my answers willynilly,1
  unlikely its good to know that you dont understand the downvotereversing system,1
i really appreciate your work and comments on this thread actually those comments run beyond my expectation i might need to recheck my question statements for clarity or i should fire another question then,1
how do i do that in c,1
this is the formula for the euclidian distance it doesnt apply to the earth since its not a linear the latlong space is not a plane,1
you dont have xyz you have latitude and longitude a coordinate system where one of the coordinates is not parallel on a spherical surphace to boot neither of your formulas works,1
   i know how to do all of them didnt quite understand it being in that form,1
  first the earth is kind of spherical second the parallels are curved on the spherical surface because they are not the shortest line between two points the definition of straight the meridians are a useful formula has to take this into account the first formula above can be a useful approximation when the distance isnt too big,1
it would be nice to have a library that can just even suggest for the review,1
what does this answer mean of course it is possible to check the text of python code for duplication just like any other language,1
  i know that you can check it however the op is asking for a library to check it for him atleast thats what i think hes trying to ask,1
  there is no reason why you couldnt create such a tool for python they exist for other languages,1
i believe the answer means youd have to roll your own duplicate code checker solution someone else probably hasnt done that yet,1
  i know you can make your own but op is asking if there is one already made,1
  your answer strongly suggests that it is impossible there is no way to really distinguish whether it has repeated or not,1
  ok i will edit it now ,1

  well unfortunately i have way too much experience in both php and answering questions so it leave no place for doubts ,1
  thats known problem with this site most answers just triggered by the keywords in the question or even just question title people seldom trying to get the meaning of the question but rather tend to directly answer to some keywords it is fastest gun in the west problem partially to blame for this and whole stackoverflow paradigm which encourage votes not real help,1
how would the compiler know if a public field of a public class is used it could be used in an assembly thats not a part of the current build,1
seconding that i do not believe the issue is what you describe inlines the values the compiler would only do that for const  otherwise ldfld is used and the jit is not going to worry overly about is this assigned elsewhere the only things that might affect this are obfuscators and full linkers like aot in mono incidentally properties would be far preferable to fields here imo,1
also methodimplmethodimploptionsnoinlining is not valid on fields so i doubt that is your real code,1
i have added more behavior comment in the code sample i dont know why or how the compilerjitter makes assumptions all i see is what the debugger shows me and that is no matter if the value is true or false it will simply not perform the true part of the if no matter value in optssilent if optimizations are enabled but will behave correctly if i disable them,1
  you are correct the statement does not work or even compile for that matter i had pasted in there to mention that i have tried this avenue without success but i forgot to remove it when i pasted the code here ill remove it,1
please post optsparse,1
what the hell is volatile doing there like eric lippert said if you are using volatile you are probably using it wrong,1
well i could post parse and all methods that go with it but that would be rather voluminous and it is not the problem parse works fine the values a read fine the debugger sees the good values its just that although after parsing optssilent is trueconfirmed by debugger and watch the code behave as if it is still false and the same goes for the other variables well this is no longer the behavior since i mark them as volatile but it is when i remove it everything would be fine if it would also be allowed on doubles,1
  volatile instructs the compiler to make no assumptions on the content of the variable as it might be changed by another thread at anytime thus disabling some optimizations on it,1
  and there is your mistake i bet you only have a single thread running making this assumption pointless  unless for some absurd reason you have parse running as a thread,1
  everything would be fine wait your claim is that this doesnt work even for the bool one no your sample is for the bool one so what is failing the bool or the double,1
but to emphasise i dont know why or how the compilerjitter makes assumptions  simple it doesnt,1
im pretty sure that volatile didnt fix your problem but just masked it you clearly do something horribly wrong in optsparse but without the relevant code we cant tell you what,1

what is the difference between powered on and rebooted,1
it starts at zero at a full boot not at a restore from sleep or hibernation  not caring about this is important not in the least because this behavior isnt promised anywhere,1
  if you dont want to answer then dont obviously theres a difference in my case,1
gettickcount can roll over dont use it for longrunning events and being rude to people trying to help you guarantees no one will answer your question,1
i think sarnold was asking for a reasonable clarification not least because a reboot does powercycle the machine making it unclear what you might have expected the difference to be,1
   sarnolds question is extremely pertinent the fact that you dont recognize it as such does not warrant rudeness especially if you expect anyone to help you after observing your attitude ill rephrase his question for you what is your perceived difference between powered on and rebooted,1
  passant so youre saying its a reboot right not a shutdown,1
thats a nonsensical distinction whats the difference between a shutdown followed by a poweron vs a reboot,1
  its important here not to be rude to people youre asking for free help  asking for more information or clarification isnt not wanting to answer please try and be polite and there is absolutely no difference between a shutdown and a reboot a reboot is a shutdown with a restart to the os the difference is only meaningful to the bios and hardware,1
the problem is that nobody has yet figured out what the value is while the machine is shut down,1
you dont power on an os  you power on a physical piece of hardware  anyway it should be pretty trivial to test whether gettickcount returns a value indicating when windows was started and when the hardware was powered on,1
the difference between a machine having been shutdown vs rebooted is that a shutdown can be followed by a poweroff when reboot does not still why does it matter what i need this for obviously i do otherwise id not ask it here is it also worth going into all this polemic vs simply answering the question and to sarnolds question  my answer was to the way he worded it when i read it,1
a shutdown can be followed by a poweroff huh how can a shutdown not be followed by a poweroff when reboot does not according to whom still why does it matter what i need this for it doesnt  nobody asked that to begin with is it also worth going into all this polemic vs simply answering the question yes because your question is nonsensical and we need to make sense of it in order to answer it come back when you learn how to ask a proper question or at least learn how to not be rude to people trying to help you,1
  what is not clear in my question you reboot computer and it simply reloads os  the power is not turned off when someone shuts it down the power can be switched off or computer can be powered off i want to know if rebooting a computer resets the tick counter how else do you want me to word it to skip all this bs,1
you reboot computer and it simply reloads os  the power is not turned off according to whom why do you think this were back to your perceptions here which you have yet to adequately explain,1
i hope my edit clarifies things,1
   until someone describes the perceived difference to the os between rebooting and restarting and shutting down then powering on i doubt it,1
httpenwikipediaorgwikirebootingcomputingsoftreboot,1
and btw i am pretty sure this can be empirically tested,1
   again regarding soft reboots what is the difference to the os which is whats being queried here,1
  based on the answer below nothing,1
   exactly my point ,1

  i will do that jspref  although the question is important i have to convert my script to object literal notation anyway  when that is eventually done ill put it on the site and place a link here,1
" t i only half answered your request for clarification   
proper objects  objects created using object literal notation  all use of the word object refers to that as opposed to a regular object under javascript",1
  i have no idea why you have this requirement there is no distinction between objects initialised with object literal notation and objects built up in some other fashion beyond syntax at the point of initialisation absolutely none at all its like asking how to convert a car to a proper car where proper car means the car was built in japan rather than korea its meaningless,1
 t the requirement is mainly educational  i guess it boils down to this  i currently am not wrapping my functions within objects but that would change if i use that style  if i understand your answer object literal notation is an issue of style and will have the exact same performance as other javascript objects that contain functions  i should research performance issues in javascript relating to dereferencing where objects are concerned  i think,1
  yes more or less whether you created an object with object literal notation or not has no bearing whatsoever on the object itself  its just an initialisation syntax,1

adding a reference to a dll in another projects bin directory is typically a very bad thing especially if the projects are in the same solution and you have a build server set up it will cause headaches,1

php sessions are not stored in ram but as files on the disk and who told you they are lost when the webserver is restarted,1
   i didnt realize php sessions were stored on disk that said my point on durability stands if the server crashes as opposed to restarts you lose your session data with redis or mysql backed sessions you have better durability,1
even then you dont necessarily lose them unless the os crashes and the session file is damaged or wasnt actually written to the harddisk yet,1
i would also think that if redis is installed on the same machine as phpthe webserver then it would not count as reading over the network,1
given that php native sessions are stored on disk the point of security is no longer valid,1

quoting the exact number does actually help its the string of digits for the project euler 8 problem   you could use a bignum library but in this case you can solve the problem easily by leaving it as a single character string and just looking at 5characterlong substrings,1

please post the code it seems you are using the pointers in a wrong way in your code,1
float and float is a different type,1
from all error messages i think its pretty obvious that he is trying to use a pointer to float as a float or not,1
its great that you posted the error messages unfortunately theyre not of much use without the code,1
you should usually post the code but i can assume from the error messages that in lines 28 and 39 you compare between a float which is either a pointer to a float but in this case you mentioned arrays and a float which is probably a regular variable or a spot in your array just make sure that if its an array you use in lines 28 and 39 you should always use square brackets and when its lines 29 and 63 the problem is probably assigning a float variable the value of a pointer which is probably your array again make sure to use square brackets to mention where in that array,1

coming from metathis question is actually not the worst quality wise you explained what you did and what the problem is however i think you have been downvoted because its almost impossible for someone to help you without seeing your code and your environment as indicated by the answers all anyone can do is tell you how to debug yourself so is better suited to questions which can be definitively answered if you find the solution to your problem your answer could help to make this question more useful for the community though ,1

the printfs are incorrect there behaviour is undefined there is no parameters given for the printfts d,1
guys if u dont know the solution of this problem  then leave the thread dont try to ruin the discussion,1
it looks pretty basic to me your code is totally broken so it can produce any output because it has undefined behaviour look up the printf documentation,1

the remove method of an event should not remove all handlers but rather the handler that was requested to be removed,1
if hes only added one then if he only removes one in effect hes removed them all  im not saying use it in all cases just for this specific resharper message,1
but you dont know that the delegate is always removing the only item on the invocation list  this is making the resharper message go away by turning correct working code into incorrect broken code that will in certain circumstances coincidentally work but that will break in unusual and hard to diagnose ways in many cases,1

your method returns error using bridging headers with framework targets is unsupported,1
  you cant use a bridging header in a framework target as the error suggests  the only option is to put it in the main framework header file unfortunately,1
if you had actually red the title of this thread you would have seen that the guy is wanting to import the commoncrypto library into a swift framework you cannot use bridging headers in frameworks and you cannot import the commoncrypto framework into the umbrella header,1

var item  thisisnotanarray,1
thats a bad solution a string has also a length,1
actually a string is an array of characters so in essence this does work,1
   string is a primitive typehttpsdevelopermozillaorgenusdocsglossarystring in javascript whereas array is an object in common language youre correct  a string is an array of characters  but in javascript this assertion is wrong its an important distinction and the reason why this is a bad answer,1
no a zerolength array is still an array,1
you can put typeof item  object and the answer can be acceptable,1

why is the array 2dimensional,1
you guys think i dont have my book doesnt cover it neither does my teacher its not like i dont want  to learn it  i just asked to create a static method i dont like coming on here because people are rude and assume the worse this was my last resort hence why i posted ive gone on google  i know how to search im a big boy thank you very much lastly my book absolute java only covers static method quickly and gives double value if i take any 2d array i should not be able to mix it with doubles if the array are objects you guys dont need to assume your goal should be,1
my question was just towards 2d arrays and using them with a double values like i was asked i know how to code a method i just didnt know where to start which was my question i dont want anyone to code it for me you guys dont need to downvote to oblivion the goal of this website is for people to learn not to be spoon fed and you guys steer newbies away from learning  most of you,1

please provide that to your question ,1
this code only i have used to trying to set the stream content,1
you can try use data  filegetcontentslogopng instead using file and img in fopen to get the image content,1
if i use like this mean where i want to specifies the read mode for logopng file,1
please check my answer i dont try it first but i hope itll run well you can try it ,1

how does it work and what did you expect instead btw this became an audit and is now featured on meta httpmetastackoverflowcomquestions291502isthisanothergoodreviewauditquestion,1
is it absolutely necessary to change the tags can you use an img and div and show and hide them respectively,1
you need to show more examples,1
you could start by reviewing the spec for nsstring,1
do not use center its been deprecated,1
since html4 ad 1997,1
your code doesnt compile at all formatstring is being called incorrectly what output are you expecting 1 until this information is provided so shouldnt be expected to get your code to compile by the way,1
cant you do this with just printf by itself,1
calc1hours  calc2hours is an expression returning a value but you havent assigned the return value to anything so it is lost neither of the operands are actually changed,1
  dont take it personal everything on so is about the content of a question or answer not a person the comment above is just a result of my vote to close on this particular question,1
time1 and calc1 are not related in any way,1
the code would not compile with an abitrary good compiler and wall because the returnstatement is missing,1
evaluating a subtraction eg 10  7 doesnt turn 10 into 3  the value of the subtraction is 3 and you need to store that someplace else eg calc1hours  calc1hours  calc2hours but this can be abbreviated as calc1hours  calc2hours as noted in the answers,1
your while loop isnt doing anything because n is not 0 but 10 try with n  0  as long as n is not 0 loop,1
yeah got it now it works thanks ,1
you are saying while n is 0 do this n is initially 10 so the loop is never executed,1
just fyi if youre stuck and not going into debugging just put a few print statments around and youll see that n is 10 so the while loop will never run just a handy way to see things sometimes systemoutprintlnn before the loop  then print something the while loop youll never see this then after the while loop should give you an idea whats running not running,1

what do you mean by the extension name appears in the file name  where does it appear  if you were creating a file exampletxt but the txt is showing up in a windows explorer window and you werent expecting it to the problem is with your windows settings not with the java program,1
sorry this is windows filenames question not java,1
ehh this is completly diffrent question now ,1
you mean the solution provided by   is irrelevant,1
i think you need to delete this question and ask a new one probably with a windowsexplorer tag  if you create a file whose name ends in txt it will have a txt extension  if you want a file with a txt extension but you dont want to see the txt in a list of files then its a windows explorer question  it has nothing to do with your program or with any programming language,1
i think he will still be able to open it with notepad  only he needs to choose the program to open with manually,1
are all the other text files on your computer also shown as example2txt and this file shows as exampletxt but not exampletxttxt or anything stupid like that,1
i think   is right this is the problem with windowsexplorer,1
  problem is possibly a bit harsh personally i hate it when an operating system has been set up so the file extention isnt shown,1
whats the question,1
yes i cant think of a solution for this it was asked in an online round can anyone help me with the algorithm,1
  yes once i get a logic for the solution i would definitely post it on my blog   and as you said stack overflow is for questions,1
the output is a little confusing the input numbers are not distinct but youre asked to print at least one of them how will you know which one the output refers to,1
  i dont have the exact question i wrote the question as much as i remembered could you help me getting the minimum of such bombs leave printing the index,1
can you give an example of two snippets whose compared performance youre interested in,1
"sadly i cant  its confidential work for my independent study im an undergrad  but i can say that the original code can run 10000 main loops with an initial energy of 100 or 100000 and will take 5 minutes and 24 hours respectively so ive been trying to optimize it as best as i can

edit  original code was written 10 years ago too",1
is said to be slower please give evidence for this statement who said that was it supported by data 10 years ago most compilers had difficulty to achieve the same level of optimisation but today there are absolutely not differences in performance afaik,1
you dont have to put your actual code few people do we all have privacycontractual concerns but you always can post representative snippets of code so that we can better help you otherwise we are all guessing,1
of course depending from what you do in those cycles anything can happen but they  sound a bit too slow to me did you enable the optimizations of your compiler what compiler are you using,1
  when you profiled the original code how much time did you determine was spent accessing data compared to doing all the other math etc that your simulation is doing where was your actual bottleneck what about in your new code also it may be worth noting that theres zero difference between a c array and a c array,1
sorry for the late response also the original code isnt mine and is well over 5 thousand lines of code in fortran a language im not too confident in  in terms of bottlenecking im still unsure as to where that may be though i think having reread through the code it might be due to the original one writing to files in each loop instead of batch writing every say 50 loops,1
why 50 millions of tables not 50 millions of servers,1
now seriously what original issue youre trying to solve how are we supposed to tell if its good or bad if we dont know what is being solved,1
i am not sure i understand this but i have one server and one database,1
i am storing tons of images the images are stored as files in the database i am putting the info about the images location time username,1
what exactly is wrong with just one table and 50 million records,1
so why not one db one table 50million rows,1
in my case is it better to have 50m tables or 50m rows,1
  how would you select from them in that case and why did you even start thinking about having 50m of tables,1
based on the 20 character unique image id,1
ok its 20 character id so what is there a rule as soon as you have 20 character id  create a table per row,1
seems like i am being squeezed in the corner the question is simple is 50m tables bad if yes how to deal with this,1
  50m tables is terrible how to deal with this  as you would deal if you had 42 rows or 42k rows  with a single table and multiple rows,1
  yes exactly,1
is there any limit to the number of rows,1
is there a point where i should split the tables eg how many rows with a primary key is it a good idea to have,1
  why,1
mysql can handle millions and millions of records before it needs partitioning,1
something else in my design i have 3 rows per table how can i move this to one table,1
i may get fired but at least i have a metagross level 100,1
you are very correct but this brings a bigger question should one study and learn or learn by trial and error to be honest i am amazed this isnt locked,1

so what happens when you analyze tempx and tempy string contents just prior to calling add on them what do they hold do they have extra spaces,1
if you still want an answer youll need to find out what strings are failing to parse and post them here print them to the console with characters surrounding them like systemoutprintln  x   in case there is trailing whitespace also do not swallow that exception in nextactionperformed at least print its stack trace so you find out if an exception is being thrown,1
works fine unless the references to it are taken from the array  does that mean that your posted code string tempx  aracc2 string tempy  aracc3 string outs  addtempx tempy works but the ui freezes if you change it to string outs  addaracc2 aracc3,1

changing the compile version and the target is not a solution just a workaround that will prevent you from using new apis,1
functions are depreciated as typically a newer more improved alternative has been included its counter productive and just incorrect to use this method id recommend either content values as mennaallah sami has provided or mapstring string,1

while this may incur a small penalty it can be done once before comparing the pattern to any input string so the timecomplexity is o1 not on where n is the length of the input string in short the impact is minimal at best,1
 and what precisely is the error,1
you should use braces around your if and for statements to avoid ambiguity also remove punct makes no sense,1
as you could see the question doesnt require you to store the result you traverse every character one by one why not just write the each character one after another if it is not a punctuation,1
error cannot bind stdistream aka stdbasicistreamchar lvalue to stdbasicistreamchar,1
 çkinsavaşçı can you please give the solution ,1
you arent going to learn anything if someone just hands you the solution youll probably want to use stdgetline instead of streaming in data via operator,1
  i am programming in c11  so i dont think there is a need to use stdgetline,1
i dont think  famous last words,1
if someone asked you to write a word processorwould you think a traditional compiler would be able to understand a program like while user makes input  process the words   perhaps the likes of google and siri have given you the impression that you can just write remove punct or remove punct if it is either a period or a comma  but putting parentheses after an if doesnt magically allow you to write anything you want as a condition nor does putting a semicolon at the end of a line of text make it code  the language has rules  the book is for learning them,1
and the problem is,1
what is the question,1
your conditions are not sufficient,1
so n1 can never be biggest,1
you never assign a value to biggest basically this overwrites a piece of your input any time a test passes,1
among other things you should be assigning a value to biggest eg biggest  n2 rather than n2  biggest,1
  the problem is that it returns 0 instead of returning the biggest number,1
i know but how could i be while there are these kind of people who did not reading question and wrote commentsi am sorry but people should be more careful while they are reading the question the should read well,1
  youve already had an answer to that you never assigned a value to biggest thats trivial the rest of your program is wrong and you have several suggestions that answer that but youve downvoted all of them,1
the inaccurate comment cout does not return 0 it may output 0 or who knows what or nothing at all at the end of your code does not constitute a question try something like why does this output 0 instead of the biggest number,1
there your question now has a question youre welcome,1
i dont understand what you mean by a full pyramid can you post an example of the desired output,1
  edited the post to the output that i want is there any way to post the picture of the output that i wantthank you,1
  i want to print again the same output but with spacelike one triangle from the left with this numbers and one from the right just like the output,1
you cant its a one way function not intended to be reversible,1
well md5 is more or less considered broken by now its likely that we will see significant advances in breaking md5 in the next couple of years so if you can wait 10 years then it should be possible with a combination of advances in cryptanalysis and computing power to do this in a practical timeframe even without the use of rainbow tables,1
you didnt supply any password when encrypting it so it wouldnt be a useful form of encryption even if it were encryption since anyone could run the decryption function,1
 örg no the hash does not contain enough information about the original string it isnt a matter of complexity,1
why do you think there is some error looks good to me,1
am i doing something wrong  at a guess youve assumed that the arguments to point are latitude followed by longitude rather than longitude followed by latitude,1
"when displaying geopointstastext lat and long should be other way 

i have double check returned values for stastext for both a geography point and a geometry point 

for a geometry point the returned values are correct as per stx and sty property extensions 

for geography points stastext returns the wrong values for point it should be point lat long

this is a bug which i will report it",1
its not a bug its point long lat as should be obvious when you can find plenty of examples when the first parameter is greater than 90,1
"it is definitely a bug check out the stastext for a geography column 
truncating a value is one thing completely swapping the values is a bug which is the case here definitely a bug",1
okay well try saying it another way look at the example in stpointfromtexthttpmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarybb933979aspx set    geographystpointfromtextpoint12234900 4765100 4326 if you can provide me a link to a map showing the location on earth of that point at a latitude of 122 as you claim then you might have a point,1
andrew please check wickedfans correctly referenced linked from msdn points are represented as pointlatlongsrid consider a case where data needs to be converted from geography to geometry there are several ways of doing this one of which is to use stastext which produces the text pointlatlong etc this will not work as the geography version creates the wrong text but the geometry insertion expected pointxy etc this method also allows for change of projection,1
damientheunbeliever please check the example i gave and my reply to andrew wickedfan also correctly provided the reference to msdn documentation of the definition of point in this case i am trying to convert large amount of data from geography to geometry and change the projection at the same time hence the reason for using staastext and not the binary version staastext for geography should return the value of point as per definition on msdn,1
damientheunbeliever put any value you like below 90 for geography version the staastext function still returns swaps the values around,1
   ive pointed you at an example where a geography is constructed from a wellknown text using a first parameter of 12234900 where on the globe do you think that this point is located the convention in wkt is long lat not lat long this is different from the convention you may have expected but its not a bug what it may indicate is that because you assumed it was lat long youve entered your data incorrectly,1
final note if you think this is a bug then submit a bug report to microsoft instead of discussing it here we cant help you to fix this bug we are not microsoft you can disagree with me but my point stands as others seem to agree with my answer,1
"   without a doubt this is a bug i dont live or die by stackoverflow equally i dont make comments publicly without thoroughly testing it i needed to ensure this is a bug  as it may have an impact on other peoples projects equallyhence my attempted consultation on stackoverflow it is important that people on this forum equally act responsibly as their comments and marking has an impact on other peoples projects

standard c has no parsers,1
what does your documentation for  say does it say that it supports arbitrary boolean expressions mine doesnt,1
  im unclear what you want here are you expecting tobool to take in a string and evaluate it as a logical expression,1
yes im not sure if im doing this right but this function handles with simple requests like true  false etc,1
 is not a boolean expression parser it is simply being used to convert true or false and nothing else,1
what error you getting,1
as error says so any of your select query return more than one value thats why you got error debug that using print after each select query so that you can find where exactly error is  or create sqlfiddle,1
one of your select stament returning more than one value instead of returning single value try running each select statement individually for that particular id,1
some of your sub queries returning more than on value execute sub queries separately and verify,1
seems you are here just to troll instead of helping  ,1
you really need to take a typing or keyboarding class so you dont need things like define pb pushback  this kind of abbreviations make your program less readable and more difficult to code inspect,1
you are crossing the streams by using stdin and cin  reference movie ghostbusters  decide either c streams or c style io printf or cout fscanfstdin or cin,1
invest in spaces around operators as it makes code easier to read  the spaces are free dont add any time to compilation build or execution  the spaces dont add any more size to the executable  an easy to read program will contain less defects  unless your keyboard isnt working correctly,1

i was specific i want the menu to look like that in the link and i copied over the html and css after pressing f12 but it doesnt display the same whats so not specific about that,1
youre supposed to show that youve put some effort into this yourself instead of asking for how to execute your idea try it yourself look at the source for that page and see if you figure it out if you run into barriers while you try to find your solution then post your questions in a thorough and detailed way thats likely why it was down voted,1
ok where is your try,1
your result array must be shorter than source in java it is impossible to change array length,1
i was looking specifically for the logic ie what could be the approach to the problem like say for the word apple if i shift the index to the left once i found any repeated character and it would be like aplee after the final iteration  now how to removedrop the last index of the array so as to make it aple,1
there are lots of ways to solve this  i expect your interviewer was more interested in how you approached the problem than in the specific solution  also  he  she would want to know if you have a clear understanding of how java arrays work eg that you cant make an existing array shorter or longer,1
this is cstyle cast,1

for example i need to cat etcshadow which permission shows as  1 root root i have no right to change it by using chmod and when i use other user to running phpfpm when a php script do systemcat etcshadow it return permission denied,1
you could create a group shadowreaders and put the phpfpm user into that group then sudo chown rootshadowreaders etcshadow and sudo chmod gr etcshadow,1
i have no right to do any operating to the file such as chmod,1
then you will never have a chance to run anything as root,1
ok thank you so as you say the only way is to compile a new phpfpm,1
no im clearly saying dont run phpfpm as root,1
this is not a valid answer to the question there are times where phpfpm should be given root privileges for example i have a singleuser linux vm set up behind nat all port forwarding is only done from my loopback adapter this vm shares dirs with the win32 vm host and the utility which shares the resource requires all files to be owned by rootroot on the linux guest os only solution is for php5fpm to also run as root in order to be able to readwrite to filesdirectories in the shared location this is a perfectly fine usecase for running php5fpm as root,1
same as i did chown r rootroot   now vim can only run as root,1
  sometimes the best answer to how do i x is very much dont ever do x  consider things like writing an accounting package in bcpl or an operating system in cobol or pretty much anything in perl pax ducks for cover running vast complicated processes as root is an incredibly bad idea if the process needs some superpowers give it execute access to a very tightly controlled executable that can do it instead and thats all it can do locking down a small tightly controlled executable is far easier than locking down a vast behemoth,1
re dont ever do x i believe that this is sometimes valid but in this context where the utility in question provides a command line flag called allowtorunasroot the highest voted answer is correct and should be accepted,1
  why do you need it to run as root note that even apachenginx are not running as root i dont see a reason why a development server by selfdescription should run as root and it never needs to  do if you have a proper development environment thats what my answer is saying,1
  my particular use case is a docker container where phpfpm needs to write to a mounted directory  there are probably others  again if the utility exposes a method of doing so easily why shouldnt that be the accepted answer,1
  i would like to give an advice in your particular use but i wont here in comments because i simply dont know enough about it and i dont say it is always a simple solution i can only clearly say that youll never release a software in a halfway organized company that requires a web server to run as root thats for sure i mean your use case sounds like you are about to not only do this in development where php s is meant for but also in production i encourage you to ask a question on serverfault or superuser,1
  another thing while i would have not implemented the dont run as root restriction at all there must be a reason why php developers decided so i would simply leave it up to the user to do that or not or better saying shoot in his own feet or not i mean you can run apache as root if you want for example however i cant say why they then added the r option that makes no sense imo i only say dont run a web server as root,1
let us continue this discussion in chathttpchatstackoverflowcomrooms113450discussionbetweenhek2mglandthreeve,1

this is a misleading answer please select the colinhoemigs answer as its much more helpful,1

i would suggest removing this as the correct answer primarily because it is wrong i personally find maxwell collards answer to be the best,1
yeah and i even tried fixing it but the hate is real also the initial down vote was for this is completely wrong unless randomnumber is gaussiannormal to start with but i had in mind the exact situation where unless randomnumber is gaussiannormal to start with,1

this isnt angular,1
im sure its and there should be a way but in certain applications online banking for example you cant just display the visual interface of an online banking account even when theres no values or no information,1
2 years ago and i do still think the same way after having done a few angular applications without any problem and i usually change my mind in this case i didnt i still believe that in some cases showing even the plain useless html code of your interface is a risk and you clearly dont work in security,1
give me the reason and the solution to solve this problem,1
  you cannot use the variable symbol name twice in the same scope,1
if copy the string in the other string variable and the try to create the objectthen also it gives error string s1 the strcpys1name then test s1,1
  u can also face the same problem if u go and work with real time problems,1
you cant specify a variable name at runtime variable names exist only at compile time perhaps you could describe why you want to give it a runtime name so we could suggest an alternative solution,1
you cannot achieve this using c variable names only exist up to the point of compilation and what you want to do is assign a variable a name at runtime which is clearly after the compilation,1
i have a feeling you want some mapping from entered strings to objects like a stdunorderedmap such that you can enter the same string later and access that object because the string is the key,1
  seymour i got this problem in a coding event,1
its evil  hint  if your string doesnt contain any u youll get a segfault otherwise it will simply count the number of characters preceding the first u of the given string,1
how about running it and see if you wanted you could even ptrint out the result of 1  funstring  1,1
itll be better question if you explain more about what youve tried and why you think like that,1
it reckon the successive u from the beginning,1
run in a debugger and step through the code line by line entering the recursive call if it comes that far,1
also theres no such languages as cc c and c are two very different languages even if parts of their syntax is similar,1
  if the string doesnt contain any u it returns 0 the function simply counts number of u in a row from the beginning of the string why do you think it makes a segfault i cant understand,1
  suppose the string is dynamically allocated and is 6 bytelong its content is hello0 after having checked the last character string5 0 which is  u we will call the function again and dereference string6 which is not allocated ,1
  if the string content is hello0 then the first line of the function will return 0 and stop recursing when it encounters h as the first character h  u,1
oh yes my bad  didnt read carefully enough still if the string is full of u and not null terminated the risk remains although much more unlikely,1
ive one idea write some code,1
what are you trying to achieve,1
what exactly do you mean by parse what information are you trying to retrieve,1
why are you skipping indices id use a dictionary,1
try a regex something along the lines of at2 digits to give you a rough idea your current solution is weak because it first assumes that each line is a complete string and doesnt factor in all digit possibilities,1
"i already write a tons of ideas first making a list and join the spliting  i get something like a1a10 but i cannot access to a or 1 after maybe using the string and using their access but i get confused to check ex my string can be

if you are getting a compile time exception then that means there is some wrong code present in your program which is not letting it compile so if possible please post your code that way people here can help you,1
it could be php but im not pretty sure i would also want to know what language he is using if you find please update me too thanks,1

"  jimenez
okay it is really long though",1
  i dont use breaks either do you use rects instead of sprites,1
do you also have a question ,1
yes it doesnt show list view,1
you are correct it doesnt show the list view due to the exception that you have demonstrated  please ensure you include the actual question you are wanting answered so we can help further,1
errors are clearly shown in the error stack ,1
i know theyre telling me the erros but these errors simply dont exist,1
you need to define the enum first and then use them in the function declaration you have reversed the order,1
what does please dont vote this down for absolutely no reason with your software problem please reread help→tourhttpstackoverflowcomtour which clearly states no distractions no chitchat,1
even if you resolve the above errors you will be left with two more similar errors  enum door  first1 second third  door lastpicknull  you cannot use the enum like above,1
unfortunately though compilers are very good at assembling machine code from wellformed source code they are remarkably bad at assembling errormessages  all of them are bad and linkers worse  one syntax error can generate pages of utter rubbish as the compiler digs itself an everbigger hole often the only thing you can do is look at the first line flagged as erroneous carefully examine it and mess about until you find out what is really causing the problem eg using enums before declaring them,1
you start to count at 0 not 1 your array has 10 elements but the last one has the index 9 not 10,1
first thanks for these message then ive to say that im a real begginer in the world of developement i know there is some problem and i want to improve myself also im sorry if i wasnt clear in my explication will try to correct this  anyway i will try to see what you say stefan,1
if you had to enter the number of children you plan to have do you think you need decimals there or will a natural number no decimals suffice  next to this there are performance reasons,1
floats and doubles also have a lot of precision problems that integers do not have,1
in addition to stultuskes comment floating point arithmetics are a bit of a nightmare,1
some of the bits in floating point numbers are used for an exponent so the range of integer values of a float which is 32 bits is smaller than the range of an int 32 bits for instance this linkhttpukmathworkscomhelpmatlabrefflintmaxhtml says that the largest consecutive integer in ieee single precision is 16777216 224 which is far smaller than the largest integer in an equivalent integer type  2147483647 231  1,1
  realy good example,1
you can keep any integer number in a variable of type doubletry to compare double5000000000000l and double4999999999999l to see why youre wrong,1
more details would be highly appreciated and would help to solve your problem,1
is there something else you think it should be have you tried simply going through the sequence of steps the program would perform,1

i didnt downvote but i dont understand your question,1
i am looking for something like documentinnerhtml cause documentdocumentelementouterhtmldoes not return the expected result,1
i updated the question to make it more precise hopefully and if you downvoting people would please just leave a comment why you downvoted it will help me improving the question thank you,1
i think it returns the expected result but maybe not the desired result  so i assume your problem is the comments outside the html elements,1
i understand the answer is unhelpful especially since the question is also tagged c however by providing the length of the string in another variable you effectively make zeroterminated strings capable of everyhting lengthprefixed strings are capable of with the same performance,1
at that point its not a null terminated string its a string prefixed by a length and good luck passing that thing around,1
use settimeout search for it,1
if you had a bug while using it please reproduce your problem and show us the relevant code,1
well if you want to call teh function after 13 seconds then it should not be 13000 just use 13000 no minus,1
based on your edit it may appear to be stuck because startcalculation isnt doing very much it looks up the price element then reassigns the variable to another elementss innerhtml discarding the element and doing nothing more with the html perhaps you meant something like elementvalue  windowvinnerhtml,1
you also need to wrap that in a windowonloadfunction,1

add a space in the macro eg define operator10  define operator 10 and do the same for the other macros,1
the compiler gives you the line no with error descriptionquite sufficient to understand,1
please consistently indent the code for readability by us humans  suggest 4 spaces after every opening brace  and unindent before every closing brace ,1
the compiler is telling you exactly what line the error usually syntax error is on and what the error is   suggest enabling line number on your editor go to the indicated line fix the syntaxspellingwhatever,1
white space between tokens is almost always necessary  white space between code blocks makes code much easier for us humans to read,1
regarding this line returnsymbol0symbol symbolt 0 is not normally considered a white space characters  however n is considered white space,1
always indent with spaces not tabs   this is because tabs are not a consistent width  the actual width depends on the settings of the individual word processor or editor,1
now i have only one error 120 error syntax error before  token,1
the header file conioh is not portable suggest removing that line replacing clrscr with systemcls replacing getch with getchar,1
the system function gets is depreciated due to its many problems and soon to removed from the c language  suggest using fgets,1

hey now i have only one  error syntax error before  token    can you find solution for this,1

if you have javascript thats executable by a browser then anyone using your page can view and see what it is too  if you want to keep things secret dont send them to the client,1

what are you trying to remove only instances of floatright any float style all styles except width,1
i would like to remove all the floats and leave the width there are more than one float in the documents html that i am using,1
this is an extremely weak form of security if the content is given to the client by the server then you have to assume the userattacker can access it regardless of whether or not its present in the dom all authorization logic must be enforced by the server,1

i don’t get it in your previous questionhttpstackoverflowcomq311851872711488 you have been told that the code does not work this way why are you bringing it up again there are no fields named class in your class,1
  1 i did not get the meaning of 1  class              2              annotationtypeexample 2 i clearly did not understand when class member comes into existence,1
constant pool entries are nothing special they are just constant pool entries 1 could have been 39123 and it would have worked just fine its referred to by the field thisclass in the class file format to indicate the name of this class and class is not a member but an expression and it does not come into existence,1
there is no member named “class”,1
what is the question do you have any special problem errors and how does the method where this code comes from look like,1
the right syntax is if balance  0  balance  10000,1
please post all relevant code so that we can compile and run our tests,1
id suggest you read a tutorial on the ifelse constructhttpsblogudemycomcsharpifelse,1
and one on httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask,1
  i have edited my answer with relevant code,1
i dont think balancerange is clearly named for a function that checks an amount for validity and it should not set the balance but just return a bool,1
also c has properties so you can have public balance  get  return balance   instead of get and set functions,1

what is the issue you are facing,1
this means the instance of the class that you are in,1
it is mainactivity class from the from mainactivityjava file which is automatically created when we start new app in android studio  ,1
read my answer then,1
when you reopen the app wont same code get executed again and button would be created,1
no when reopen the app i want to see the  button created last time,1
how do you know if its a newly created button or the old one,1
in test i created a button  i can see it and use it but after reopen the app the button disappear,1
well i dont think its possible adding button from xml is probably the best idea,1
ok so i can just use the setvisibility method right,1
can you give us a more info like what the buttons are supposed to do or why would you need those buttons created on the fly,1
i an trying  to build albums and thats why i need the buttons still there after reopen,1
because there is a comma in your test string,1
did you try googling anything about the split method,1
er editrecordsno,1
try editrecordsno,1
you can assign it to a variable var variablesno then pass variable to other function,1
actual that is global variable it increase for every row i try editrecordsno but it takes global variable valuelast row value  ,1
 li ah i think you want to pass the variable to the function everytime it changes without calling the function again,1
i try like that also its not working uncaught referenceerror variable  is not definedonclick  assignment2html1  ,1
  doodler he want to pass sno to other function may be sno is not global variable he can declare a global variable and assign sno to that variable,1
why are you using sno in onclickeditrecordsno,1
you can also write onclickeditrecord,1
it is totally unclear what are you asking please explain in more detail,1
how about sobjectsfilterrpgivenp ,1

besides i havent found it on google or any booksall the articles were based on cso im asking is there any way to do it,1
how about  you try something first and then come back and ask a specific question if you get stuck on something,1
first try to think of the steps you need to take to solve this problem then try to solve each step and if you get stuck at one step come back and ask a question about this specific step,1
but i hv explicitly specified the digit places,1
please edit the question and add the code there longer strectches of code arent very readable in comment markup,1
now that you have posted the code do you see a pattern could there something be gained by switching from explicit variable names like n1 n2 n3 and so on to an array with n0 n1 etc take care your output is in the wrong order,1

  also you can never know what apple decides to change with the next versions of ios even 1px difference would break this,1
this answer is really poor advice you should rarely rely on magic numbers in general programming and almost never  in ui programming apple frequently changes the size of ui elements just look at ios 11 with major changes to title elements  if you dont have direct access to the element info then set up an auto layout constraint to that element and use the values from the constraint for your calculations,1

why dont you measure it,1
look at the generated assembly it may be the same i dont actually know,1
it depends on the processor compiler settings and context,1
if theres a difference it will probably favor the version using the or theres unlikely to be any difference though,1
they are only equivalent if c is an array of unsigned char if it is then the compiler can probably figure out the optimal version for the platform if its not then you are either relying on extra information to guarantee your cs are between 0 and 255 or theyre not equivalent either way the answer of which is faster will depend on the platform,1

im a student now not developeri hope im a developer in future ,1
i understand i found my fault  thanks everybody,1
you are kind of right but at the same time this does not provide any help since you can still have instances of protocols by downcasting a instance of a class conforming to the protocol,1
  you can compare references to instances of class not instances of protocol type even though someone dont agree that is the reality you are not able to create a instance of protocol,1
  downcasting doesnt change dynamictype downcasting can help you to work with the type as it is an instance of protocol hiding all class or struct  specific implementation but you still have an instance of original dynamictype,1
ok dear downvoters please provide me an example how to create reference to protocol this should be the first step to compare two references,1
although i have not down voted you yet i believe you are getting down votes because you do not answer the question you are just saying protocols do not have instances which is not the problem here,1
   operator compare references reference means that you have an instance you are not able to create an instance of protocol that means you are not able use  operator for protocols,1
it does not matter if the protocol itself is an instance  the point is to check if  2 instances that conform to a protocol are the same instance so if class a and class b both conform to protocol p they can still be compared to see if they are indeed the same instance,1
  you can but you are responsible to cast the reference to the same reference type,1
that is not the same thing  you cant cast class b to class a  you will get errors,1
  see my last example please,1

deleting a file on someone elses computer is probably illegal  deleting someone elses file on a shared system without authorization is probably illegal  the determining factor is whether you are authorized to do this  actually you are more likely to get into trouble with your school than the police but you need to be aware of what the law says is in your state  country,1
yea  and asking other people to help you with an illegal activity is called a conspiracy in some legal jurisdictions,1

why are you using the c tag,1
which tag should i use for this question,1
  the tag that fits the question c,1
your main problem here is that you dont compile your program with enough warnings enabled,1
what did you try ,1

ok it seems you need to make a list of sorted sublists what have you tried so far,1
this is not really a question please provide text,1
  ghodaskar you saw my answer,1
do you know the difference between interfaces and classes,1
set is interface and hashset is class which implements set,1
you use a set if you want to create your own set because it´s an interface,1

like text in input field,1
i suggest you read mdnhttpsdevelopermozillaorgenusdocsweb if you need a tutorial,1
one is comparison the other is assignment,1
im really tempted at closing your question as a duplicate of this one considering its the same mistake httpstackoverflowcomquestions1642028whatisthenameoftheoperator im not interested in seeing a new so question for every way you can combine an operator,1
in fact this should be retitled to not equals vs assigned not value,1
  this allows for different search results edited it if you like,1
i have edited to add a little context,1
what is the specific rule what have you tried,1
i havent tried anything since i dont know how to do it,1
given the information youve provided simple assignment would be sufficient s  hello,1
so only uppercase e to lowercase e x  xreplacee e,1
what if the string is unknown but the second character of the string must be in lowercase,1
then thats a different problem than youve mentioned so far and would have a different solution,1
why dont you figure out what you actually want to know then edit your question to ask that  so far youve asked three different questions two of which arent even in your question but only in the comments,1
1 and 3 are the same 2 is completely different,1
this link shows more information about this httpsfacebookgithubioreactdocsglossaryhtml,1
this is actually wrong element is not an instance element is a description,1
this blog post explain element and component httpsfacebookgithubioreactblog20151218reactcomponentselementsandinstanceshtml,1
what is the exact problem what have you tried so far please show some of your attempts,1
you can edit your post to include some code you have tried so far and sample output format your code by selecting it and pressing ctrlk,1
in the current state it is unclear what you are asking,1
its a negative sign,1
please read one of the books in the introductory section herehttpstackoverflowcomq3882422069064 they will help you a lot more at this time than so,1
so you know its an operator so why not start by searching for c operatorshttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrary6a71f45daspx  first result will point you to herehttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysa7629ewaspx the  operator is also used to specify a method that will be called in response to an event such methods are called event handlers the use of the  operator in this context is referred to as subscribing to an event ,1
you may not be familiar with vbnet but in case you are it is equivalent to an addhandler statement,1
why do you think something is wrong please read ask a proper question,1

why are you using an input as a link just use a proper a tag,1
as   asked why are you using input tag the attribute target will only works with an a tag,1
the reason why this one will not work is that isinstanceof does a runtime check based on the type information available to the jvm and that runtime information will not contain the type argument to list because of type erasure,1
 is binary xor in ruby so 23  23 but 23  1,1
thats just unnecessary looping why would you not index it directly,1
why are you defining currentpope as a list when it becomes a string in the loop furthermore why are you even defining that variable before the loop,1
just a friendly tip you may want to read over this page the howtoask guidehttpsstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask so you can always be sure that your questions are easily answerable and as clear as possible be sure to include any efforts youve made to fix the problem youre having and what happened when you attempted those fixes also dont forget to your show code and any error messages,1

it is compiling its failing at runtime,1
not sure whats up but i think your stack trace explicitly says what your error is in this line arrij  innextint,1
itd be nice to indicate in the source which is the line mentioned in the exception,1
and next step would be look at the javadocs of the library method which throws the exception in this case javautilscannernextint to see why it throws that exception then if you dont understand it though in this case it seems clear enough in the docs you might ask that what does it mean when nextint throws nosuchelementexception,1
you should check if there is another element in the collection before trying to do innextint usually you would use a whileinhasnextint as your iterator instead of a for loop javautilnosuchelementexception is thrown at runtime thats why your code compiles,1
are you sure that was the full output of gcc,1
see if the file is present  try versbose option wlverbose for additional information like where is the linker searching for the linker script  if there is the file see what permissions are ls al might help,1

this is an unorthodoxed version of an assignment operator  an assignment operator should do one thing and one thing only and that is to create a copy of the passed in object to an existing object  it shouldnt be performing business logic such as simplify,1
  i dont agree if we assume that simplify doesnt semantically change the value that is being assigned merely optimises its representation then invoking it is absolutely fine it would be rather like stdstring trimming its capacity on swap its not business logic hate that term the real problem with the ops function is that its a nonmember operator taking just one operand and not even trying to assign anything to what should be the lhs operand,1
what do you mean whats the significance of memory object,1
why do you think that abcdef will be in the string pool,1
nope abcdef will not go into string constants pool,1
also abcdef will be candidate for garbagecollection because youre not assigning the result of concat to any variable concat doesnt modify the string it creates a new one,1
i know about that thats why i asked,1
  its referencing only to the string pool then why make two objects one in heap and one in string pool while initiating first,1
  abcdef will go in string pool because thats how out bm handles string,1
  abcdef will go in string pool please check some basic java resources,1
  very true but its referencing only to the string pool then why make two objects one in heap and one in string pool while initiating first,1
   i am not talking about the string literal abcdef i am talking about the string abcdef generated by s1concatdef i assure you it does not go into string constats pool,1
  thats basicsthanks anyways i will find out that one for a little proof,1
"   
string s1  new stringabc now do s1concatdef  there is a change in object so sops1 should be abcdef not abc please check first and then do reply",1
   string s1  new stringabc now do s1concatdef  there is a change in object so sops1 should be abcdef not abc please check first and then do reply,1
why dont you test by yourself first btw you were already told twice that concat doesnt change the string it creates and returns a new one sops1 will not print abcdef it will print abc,1
  i am asking you a very simple question ie at object creation if we wrote strinf s1 new stringabc then there be object formation total 2 objects s1 is referencing to object of pool or object of memoryjvm not pool whats the significance of other object,1
now do s1concatdef  there is a change in object so youre telling us that concat changes the immutable string s1 even the javadochttpdocsoraclecomjavase7docsapijavalangstringhtmlconcat28javalangstring29 proves you wrong,1

int  employee,1
  not really since all they need to do is define an implicit cast on the employee class,1
   i specifically meant the way in which he tried ,1
note that boxinghttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibraryyz2be5wkaspx is defined as the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type  so attempting to cast to a reference type other than object even if there is an implicit cast operator would not be considered boxing,1

before your c program even gets to main it needs to load and initialize the c library and do a bunch of other stuff you could change your assembly version to use main too and link it with the c library so you get a more fair comparison alternatively you could compile the c version as standalone code,1

thanks thats the mistake i did,1
what you have tried so far,1
unsurprisingly it is  the quotes are not part of the regexp,1
i tried everything you advised but sadly nothing works ,1
the replace method takes a string and returns a string it does not affect the source string at all so make sure you are assigning the result of the call to something,1
please have a look here it works fine with replaceall httpideonecomtxueln,1
strings are immutable so you cant change them you can only produce a new string,1

the code you already have is not even valid swift,1
before you post code samples please make sure they compile  run in a playground,1
what are you trying to achieve,1
its not clear what you want to do your two functions dont return a value but they only print it on the screen if you want to sum the two values that you send as parameters to those functions you simply have to call sum24 which would be implemented as void sumint aint breturn ab there is no need for function pointers and if you want to use them for exercise its not clear how you want to use them,1
the short answer is you cannot because the functions do not return anything and a function pointer alone also cannot tell you what parameters are passed to the functions,1
  which would be implemented as  you missed to change the return type to int,1

you cant do it because the language doesnt support it or am i missing something,1

the language doesnt support it because it is an awful idea consider your example does if int i evaluate to true or false,1
why would you do that ,1
your worrying about memory is also unfounded,1
why not include the script using the url why do you want to write it to a div,1

that is the expected behviour getscript returns an object,1

is it possible   ,1
are you trying to get the code from the cdn then print it in a div,1
i am trying to get the http request response and put it in a div  is that possible ,1
i think that it would be impossible to get response without requesting through xmlhttprequest,1
afaik getscripturl gets the script and executes it you will have access to the variables in the script but not the source itself,1
 ñamaque what if i get response without xhr ,1
   thank you i believe your comment is the most helpful here,1
so   what is it that youre trying to do your question is unclear please elaborate,1

i would strongly recommend you read a book on c,1
to gain more memory you use realloc,1
  that wouldnt work here as realloc requires an initialized pointer to start with,1
"you are overwriting random memory areas that you did not reserved not only you can corrupt data but also you have no guarantee that you will be able to retrieve the data you wrote
more likely you will end up in a segfault because this is undefined behavior",1
  yes my point is to gain more you have to have something first so malloc is not to gain more it is realloc but malloc should be used first,1
  kim it is a splendid idea i like it let the compiler bothers about allocating memory somewhere where it likes,1
  kim your program would look even better if you add one minor detail including a word in the print statement for example  printfenter the maximum number of money you want ,1
  false realloc when passed a null pointer behaves like malloc,1
  but that would change the meaning maybe he wants to know what is the maximum number you want to have maybe its a count von count emulatord,1
  null is a value uninitialized pointers arent null and null pointers are initialized eg msvc will set uninitialized pointers to 0xcdcdcdcd in debug mode so you can spot the bug,1

did you try doing man printf try google the first link youll see is httplinuxdienetman3printf why dont you read it once,1
  the 1 is the minimum field width  in this format you cant get less than 5 characters generated because the exponent is printed with e a sign and 2 digits plus at least one digit before the exponent so the width is functionally ignored here  the 4 does mean 4 decimal places  if you changed the conversion specification to 104en youd get 31416e01 and using 134en youd get    31416e01 note that e formats always print just one digit before the decimal point,1

isnt that a bit like building a car by trying to assemble all the plastic bits then all the metal bits then all the rubber bits ,1
your structure is indeed the most important thing as it focuses on the content if you ever redesign your site you only need to change css and js and not the whole thing so html first then css as some people use your site with javascript disabled then javascript  javascript should be icing on the cake not the main focus,1
"there is no one best way to make a website because it is personal preference but it is always good to plan out beforehand exactly what you plan on putting in the website drawings mockups animation sketches if you dont have much experience with designing websites i would then suggest completely writing up the html not simply with divs but using good html practices such as this httpistackimgurcomb73dvjpg

then take your time designing the elements in css and javascript once you have a full skeleton of html to work on and mockups to lead your way",1
you shouldnt have to rewrite all your css if you change your code youre doing css wrong if you do,1

welcome to stack overflow questions seeking debugging help why isnt this code working must include the desired behavior a specific problem or error and the shortest code necessary to reproduce it in the question itself questions without a clear problem statement are not useful to other readers see how to create a minimal complete and verifiable examplehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,1
did you really write iostream also main needs an int return type,1
no i dont need an int return type thats why i dont know how to do it,1
let me rephrase main has to have an int return type it is a rule so write int main you dont actually have to return anything from the function because main has an implicit return 0,1
this one 0  105  10 is the same as 0  105  10 and gets the expected value by chance both true  10 and false  10 will display true,1
your text editor has nothing to do with your issues for starters probably not wise to use spaces in filenames you probably dont want to use local paths finally i understand you are a beginner but i think you may need to do a few more tutorials for both html and js you have some malformed html and your js has a lot of issues check your browser console f12 and look into those errors,1
could you clarify what you mean by this call doesnt work do you mean the call to program if so what output does it produce as compared to the output that you anticipate it should produce,1
  actually i bet its harder to find than you think its easy when you know the answer cos you know what to search for for a new programmer this behaviour is a surprise and they dont know what to search for he says he looked a lot  i believe him,1
  i looked it up bing actually and all that came up was things like how to call external programs from a c program and how to call c c etc programs for a c program,1
  ill edit an update,1
    well the compiler error is probably a good place to start  program was not declared in this scope,1
  tew  note that calling program from inside program is not the way to go you should use a while loop,1
  yes this is an example though of course in an actual program i would use a dowhile loop,1
also why am i receiving so many negative votes i feel this is an appropriate question for this forum,1
  its not a forum to be technical about it,1
are the 3 classes in the same file,1
you dont youre trying to execute adder try running sol,1
no its not compulsory to define a main method in a class that extends an abstract class there might be some other issues,1
also it may be possible that you are trying to execute adder you must have to execute sol,1
  am actually executing the sol class which says to define main method in adder class,1
please use public in front of your static void mainstring atgs as if you donnt use public this will make defaultand not be called by jvm,1
public static void mainstring args is the standard main signature which the compiler looks for,1
  have u tried after using public in front of main,1
  yeah it worked fine now thanks dude,1
   actually the compiler doesnt look for it  the compiler doesnt care if there is a main method at all  it is the java command that looks for the main method,1
i have done just now but i think ive messed up each method with the above options in is just returning 0 they do complile though which is the main thing i guess,1
i know its a shocker kocko i apologise just clutching at straws here,1
it is always 0 that is very strange since you never set a value to x there is absolutely no possible way that x has its default value ,1
think ive completely messed up the test class i just made,1
maybe you can provide something more to have a minimum working example mwe,1

i know how to use timespan to get the difference but how to set the limit using seconds and switch to mintues this is where i need help,1
help would imply you have posted code which gives us a starting point,1
take a look at the momentjs library or the livestampjs library  i think youll find what you need there,1
"  if you are familiar with what you say the you should be familiar with the following timespan duration property and if you create an instance of timespan object then you can get at the following for example 
tsdurationdays 
tsdurationhours 
tsdurationminutes
tsdurationseconds as well as txdays tshours tsminutes tsseconds",1
  yes i am familiar with that but howwhen to let it choose what to return based on difference value for example if the difference between dates is 120 mintues i do not want it to return it 120 mintues i want it to return 2 hours  how to make this switch ,1
check this out for starters and there are several examples on so as well i actually used one today and it worked most amazingly httpwwwdotnetperlscomstopwatch,1
why the downvote,1
have the function return a value and decide what to do in the calling function based on that value,1
looks like c exception at some point,1
   the question is not whether it makes sense to you the goal obviously is error handling i am hoping to achieve the interruption of a deep call chain without having to check return values,1
what do you mean by portable i know that gcc has a feature for goto across functions but wont work on other compilers,1
   it seems applicable in this scenario but it is just a small example and is not applicable in the scenario i intend to use it,1
   i added gcc as a tag to specify it is a given so by portable i mean platform portability while still using gcc,1
why is your idea simpler of better then simply returning a value from foo and having bar either return or execute somewhereelse conditionally  the point is your example does not justify the mechanism when sensible design using basic mechanisms of the language suffice in your example situation  more generally perhaps c exception handling is what you need,1
   yes it is just an example its point is to illustrate what i want to achieve not how it makes sense in actual code unfortunately i cannot use c,1
you are reinventing longjmp if you want that to be portable and general and compatible with recursive functions,1
   well not all of our systems come with a spare 150 gigs of ram to afford to be reasonable with a billion longjmps,1
a billion longjmp  will generally use a constant memory space of a hundred bytes they wont even spend a single megabyte and the billion calls to longjmp will require a few seconds in total each of them lasting a few dozens of nanoseconds,1
   somehow and amazingly so you are still missing the point that it is about error handling and achieving in practice stack unwingding so those billion jumps will require a billion buffers in fact the buffers will end up being there even if no jumps are made so to my question about zero cost error handling you are answering with a solution with an impossible cost,1
no my improved answer show that there is no billion buffer in heap only one single jmpbuf  temporarily on the call stack,1
so how do you trace back your n  1 number of steps with only one jump buffer nobody is talking about heap but the deeper you go the more buffers you leave behind so you can make the jump if you have to you can at best limit it to one buffer for each stack frame reusing the same buffer if there are more than one error prone operations per frame,1
please read more about longjmp it can unwind dozens of thousands of call frames in constant time and most call stacks dont have that much a typical call stack cannot exceed a few megabytes on most laptops,1
i am well aware of the typical stack sizes but even though the stack as a memory buffer is a flat object what happens inside has a tree structure storing a jump buffer on every frame in a deep call chain will run out of stack space in no time since even if the buffer only stores a few registers it is still a constant size construct might have been nice if the compiler actually trimmed it down to only what is needed to store a particular state,1
see my example you dont store a jmpbuf in most call frames only in some initial ones,1
as a caution lets keep this discussion civil and avoid pointed comments about other users,1
  if you dont store each of the steps then the stack unwinding will not collect all the objects in between it will all leak which is why your solution is utterly useless the goal is not to get back to where you started it is to do so and properly collect all objects along the call stack this will require a lot of jump buffers and will result in massive cpu and memory overhead,1
you could provide the code you have already written and point out where you are struggeling this would make it more likely that you´ll be getting an answer,1
youll do better here if you post code and ask questions about specific difficulties  this isnt a haz the codez site,1
how may it fail if 2 strings are given as parameters isnt there only 3 options about a comparison between them,1
how do you imagine a situation that it fails except when a null pointer is passed otherwise its just a comparison that returns how the strings compares,1
it will fail if the strings arent null terminated,1
the only ways strcmp can fail are if you pass one or two null pointers or if the strings are not properly null terminated but they need to be similar chunks of data because strcmp stops as soon as theres a difference   however that invokes undefined behaviour so anything can happen and it is valid,1
do you understand the difference between a keyword and a function call,1
yes i understand what i wanna know is how compiler handles int char etc ,1
a fundamental type is not a function it does not need to be declared its fundamental nor do basic keywords need to be declared how would you declare such things without using basic keywords,1
with all due respect no you dont please read a basic c book first,1
the compiler knows how to handle basic types and keywords because their behaviour is specified by the standard and the compiler must implement this behaviour using whichever resources are available on the architecture used for compilation this is circular logic the compiler must know how to do such basic things otherwise it couldnt compile,1
thats what i wanna know  how the compiler knows ,1
are you asking about how a compiler knows the spec for the supported language,1
printf is not defined in a header but only declared,1
languages have grammar constructs sometimes types and keywords functions are build using these things that make up a language printf is a function return is a keyword int and char are types the basic format of a function is defined by the grammar ie returntype name args  function body  compiling an expression like int a doesnt call a function its simply using the language printf is invoking a function if the compiler doesnt know about that function theres a problem its pretty obvious isnt it,1
  a compiler is just another program it reads input your code and processes it according to a set of builtin rules  it recognizes keywords like int and char and return because it was written to recognize those things,1
this example does not show any use of exception filters,1
this is standard way to filter exception in c60,1
take a look again at what exactly exception filters are you are not using an exception filter in your example theres a proper example in this answerhttpstackoverflowcoma22864936247702 posted a year before yours,1
an example of exception filtering would be catch httpexception e when egethttpcode  400  writelinebad request ,1
this does not show a way to filter exceptions ,1

myfunction should return an int,1
the writeline meth is is trying to output a value but myfunction isnt returning a value the return value is void,1
which language are you using make up your mind c or c,1
i was using c but then a friend suggested to me the swapab and that seemed to be c and it lost me because ive never used that command before,1
its incredibly easy to make your own swap function id suggest doing that and editing out c from your question,1
your main routine is defining and initializing deck but does nothing beyond that so what is your expected behaviour,1
yeah i just took out the c portion from it how could i make a swap function in my case this program can be run on visual studio 2013 the command prompt just doesnt have anything except press any key to continue and i cant figure out whats wrong,1
  uhh it seems you already have a swap function you wrote its in your code,1
is there anything else that could be added to my main i didnt know what else to put besides my array,1
  like i said though a friend suggested me to use it but i had never used it before,1
  im confused the swap function in your program doesnt depend on c its valid c code,1
possible duplicate of programming homework deck of cards dealt to players  c programminghttpstackoverflowcomquestions36705850programminghomeworkdeckofcardsdealttoplayerscprogramming,1
  thats not a duplicate thats another post that i made earlier today when i read the comments and realized my structure was completely off i didnt know how to fix it i decided to try a different approach to the assignment,1
  in that question you were calling functions in main but not here now,1
i will try and fix my main problem thanks for the feedback everyone,1
this code doesnt even compile because the number of arguments in the definition of distributecards doesnt match the number of arguments in the declaration of the prototype before,1
disagree with every and single line of the answer same comments were made for strict aliasing optimizations and those hopefully are dismissed now the solution is to educate developers not prevent optimizations based on bad development habits,1
it is a reasonable thing to argue that the standard is broken regarding this being allowed to be null for nonvcalls i dont necessarily agree but thats a fine opinion to hold for other optimizations eg the felixgcc one it is very hard to teach a compiler what is ok to optimize and what a human intended that is architecturally very unclean and might be practically impossible linus torvalds has made the same error once about an optimized out null check,1
pretty much every realworld program is undefined  not sure what is the basis of this claim the systems i work with do not rely on undefined behaviour and when such is discovered because people make mistakes it is treated as bug and fixed rather than blaming it on the compiler,1
  you can turn on that behavior using a switch and i would not condemn you for doing that i find the idea of safer versions of c and c very useful but it costs your performance in certain loops c generally is a language that is supposed to be so close to the metal that there is not enough room below c and above assembler for another language,1
  the problem with a switch is it is old code which needs that behaviour that is the code where by definition the makefile does not have the switch because it did not exist when the code was written,1
  actually those who argue against this kind of optimization want semantics which are closer to the metal,1
  semantics close to the metal but performance removed from the metal signed overflow allows you to conclude in for int i  0 i  n i that i  0 not wrapping and even n  0 apparently that is useful for certain optimizations this is what i read,1
  i am not taking sides here but i found this paper also via fefe interesting in that regard httpwwwcomplangtuwienacatkps2015proceedingskps2015submission29pdf,1
  again again this is about preexisting code not new code new code should avoid ub but new compiler versions should not break existing code,1
  that tight loop which is 30 to 40 faster because it assumes no integer overflow might be the loop which is copying the exploit over your return address on the stack,1
  for preexisting code if the user is allowed and able to compile from source common practice has been to allow the user to specify the compiler and the compiler flags to use this gives the user the ability to add options to disable specific optimisations without having to change the makefile or the code,1
  no it isnt common practice is to use the latest compiler for each new release im glad you versioncontrol your compiler and bdiff the different versions looking for breaking changes in the compiled output before upgrading but most people just dont,1
  youve read my comment just barely enough to type up a response to it but clearly not nearly enough to understand what i wrote you were saying that for preexisting code there is no way that their makefiles specify any options needed to make it work that did not exist at the time im saying that those makefiles do typically specify that the user can provide custom options your response to that totally misses my point its not about how many developers  users make use of that ability its merely about the ability being there when you say its not,1
  i understand that the user can specify options needed to make it work and for an automated build system you can set these options as a global default i get it my point is that by default there is no reason for them to believe that there is any need for them to do it there are no new warnings produced it just compiles how can they know that actually there is a breaking change there they dont read the compiler release notes they assume the compiler writer is on their side unfortunately it seems he is not breaking changes need to be optin not optout,1
step number one in writing robust correct code is to know your tools  someone who was so wholly unacquainted with their language as to mess this up is not producing secure code no matter how much help they get from the compiler  the security vulnerabilities were introduced by having incompetent programmers write the code not by the compiler upgrade,1
  and what do you think that code was doing before,1
simply recompiling previously working secure code with a newer version of the compiler can introduce security vulnerabilities  that always happens unless you want to mandate that one version of one compiler is the only compiler that will be allowed for the rest of eternity   do you remember back when the linux kernel could only be compiled with exactly gcc 2721  the gcc project even got forked because people were fed up with bullcrap  it took a long time to get past that,1
also relevant gcc warns about this httpcolirustackedcrookedcomadd3a1326e3e26097 really if you recompile with a newer compiler dont even have warnings enabled dont have tests and so fall for this you dont deserve sympathy fix your code fix your build system fix your workflow,1
  id really prefer that the c standard wasnt written by google to prevent that we have to hold google accountable for writing bad code rather than shift the responsibility onto compiler vendors and the standards committee to accommodate googles errors,1
 t hes still out there ranting against gcc specifically about this very issue we are discussing here httpblogfefedetsa9de792d,1
  were that the way things should be chrome and firefox wouldnt have become wildly popular by sticking rigidly to the standards putting an end to the torture of the hack browser wars and leading directly to the web renaissance we enjoy today,1
working code no relying on null dereference not crashing is not working code any more than writing code with race conditions works until moores law makes it not work on a new faster computer or maybe the guys who speed up the chips are also into purity instead of sticking with what works,1
 t standard should define behavior standard which defines undefined behavior is crap so fix standard compilers and after what peoples will folliw standard but not sooner,1
httpsgistgithubcomrygorouse0f055bfb74e3d5f0af20690759de5a7 this is a nice explanation of the signed overflow issue adding this here for all interested parties to see,1
its time to debug,1
welcome to so please read httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask,1
at least be a bit specific what did you expect from the code and what did you get,1
this code isnt working what exactly isnt working error messages,1
its not performing the required function 0 error messages on the console,1
i expected the code to add a button to a div element when a value in that element is equal to focus,1
i learnt js ajax php by trial and error  well perhaps now it is time to read some documentation and tutorials,1
what is the code supposed to do please write the text in english but i guess the program should run until you type in the value stored in again thus you should never change szam only tart,1
go through each line in the code with a debugger or pen and pencil and see what the value of each variable is and you will understand also try to run your program and look at the printout does it look right,1
the program is asking the user to write a number which is not the one entered before if he writes the number which was entered before the program ends,1
yes it looks right but my teacher is saying that this isnt a global variable and it gets 0 as value  only with luck,1
the program is also running well,1
then see the answers given below,1
  teacher correct you need to initialize tart variable into integer value before use,1
 means shift left,1
  because this is standard welldocumented swift syntax,1
  i mean i understand but he is new to so and maybe swift why give someone a bad experience in such a ruthless manner lol could have explained to him how so works,1
   that would only work if you limited the number of upvotes too if 10 people come along and upvote the question yet 9 out of 10 people hadnt downvoted as it was already downvoted the result vote count of 9  would make it look like a good questions the system only really works if all votes are recorded and everyone votes honestly,1
i completely agree   but i just want to point out that although 10 people downvoted not a single one had time to really comment why this question is bad,1
true and that issue downvote with no comments has been addressed on meta it seem logical to me that perhaps a comment should be required but others think not,1
what is the contents of the file what do you think happens if the strings you read are longer than 8 and 7 characters respectively note that those sizes i mentioned leaves space for the string terminator in your arrays,1
a little advice never blame the compiler ive found maybe 5 actual compiler bugs in my lifetime while my own errors are beyond counting,1
bug is in your code not visual studio your fscanf invocations do not account for strings of arbitrary length dont use what you cannot control remove the tagc tag and the c code just as well,1
maybe d1 andor d2 are too small,1
bugs in compilers are very very very rare,1
first learn to check your input ie the stuff youve read from the file then talk about compiler bugs,1
are d1 and d2 widths enough to store the cstring null terminator after strings chars,1
"dont ge me wrong i am  definitely not saying the problem is from the compiler i am just trying to know what i did wrong since it works with one and not the other

0003510 0000000 that is the line i am trying to read in the file

when compiled with cl it reads it and print it but crashes right after

i also tried to record it as a c file and to compile with cl but the problem is the same and yes i remove every c library in the include section before",1
does the problem disappear if you make d1 and d2 larger,1
what is the error message upon crashing,1
  if youre doing things more advanced than this and it doesnt work in vs it can save a lot of time to check early on and see if its a known vs bug or simply unimplemented c feature  ive wasted hours trying to figure out what i did wrong when vs simply cant deal with something like nested lambdas with auto return types,1

  as ive mentioned im trying to understand the method mentioned in that book to convert recursive into iterative ill add some examples showing where ive got stuck,1
  ive referenced the book so people who already read and understood that part of the book could help explaining how to apply the method onto a simple set of python examples the book uses a different agnostic language i dont understand why youre saying the question is not appropiate for stackexchange imho this question is like trying to solve some doubts after reading some mathematical method and then making some references to such theorem ie cooley–tukey fft algorithm linking one of the many papersbooks talking about wouldnt be in that case appropriate neither,1
that particular point turns on whether the referenced information is publicly available or small enough to include,1
  ive asked the author if it was alright to post this type of question here and she didnt mind to post it now i have been posting stuff in so for few weeks already and i still dont understand why the question ive formulated in this post which is very interesting and relevant has got negative votes and no answers at all and other trivial questions out there become really popular among people very fast,1
in my opinion the lack of approval and lack of response are because this is not yet a selfcontained question  for comparison we can easily find references on line for ackermanns function the binomial function and the others referenced  what we cannot find easily is section 43  right now your audience is limited to people who have read and understood chapter 4 and are willing to give you a tutorial on it  tutorials are generally beyond the scope of so,1

  to the contrary i made a pen a while back that shows you every single keyvalue pair in your localstoragehttpcodepeniohellol11penjqlvjd without any hacks,1
nope sorry local storage is isolated perdomain code running in one domain can not access values that were stored into local storage by another domain for example googlecom stores a bunch of stuff in local storage you will not be able to list any of the keys from googlecom in your  pen example,1

why am i downvoted,1
what does that mean,1
what folder do i put the xml layouts in,1
obviously in res  layout folder,1
appreslayoutyourxmlfilexml,1
do not jump in ans start studying z instead of a start from here httpsdeveloperandroidcomtrainingindexhtml,1
i dont see the layout folder for some reason i already work in phphtml but now im adding android to my skill set because im unable to find work after time in the service,1
find that reason then or post your screen shots,1
  what have you googled so far about this issue please always show your research when asking a question,1
no clue yet as to why its not there yet,1
layout folder is just a simple folder see the comment by shashank udupahttpstackoverflowcomquestions35474305wheredoiputmylayoutinandroidstudiocomment5864326935474305 above,1
you can create layout folder too but if it is not present from start i would recommend to create another new project,1
yes i googled the issue but it wasnt coming up on top on google i hand created it now,1
right click in resnew folder name it layout thats all,1
i created it already and it didnt show up because i chose to do a blank view,1
change the view android to project,1

modifying the react core in order to implement an antipattern is a really bad practice,1

this is the only valid solution never bypass security certificate validation period,1
actually you may need bypass validation during development when you have selfsigned certificate for example,1
cant agree for example internal developement teams at my customers use special developement internal ca which is trusted within their network this helps to validate extra cert validation code as well,1
sarcasm unnecessary and there are situations in internal development where this is useful  or the net team wouldnt be spending time coding for it,1
"sometimes you have to deal with other services and these services may have invalid certificates valid at the time of development but not renewed because the developer is gone
it happens often with automated processes for invoices even with big companies and you have to deal with it so no choice there",1
yes i shall tell the outofbusiness vendor of my 8 year old heatingcontroller that they should get back in business and renew their certificate i understand the reasoning behind your post but it doesnt answer ops question and it doesnt reflect how the world actually functions,1
reformulated without the sarcasm and with background information this answer would be more useful than it is as written its unlikely to reach its target audience in particular if you dont know why disabling the certificate check is bad and what the exact impact is of doing it anyway you have no standing to go to anyone else and berate them for their ssl practices so that advice is not useful theres also a missed opportunity in explaining alternatives to completely disabling certificate checks like checking for particular certificates even if expired,1
  please note that i have had to reproduce your question here so that i could post my answer i hope it helps,1
instead of reposting the same question you can go to the close vote reviewers chatroomhttpchatstackoverflowcomrooms41570soclosevotereviewers and request reopen votes when ive done that in the past the question has been reopened within 5 minutes i appreciate what youve done here though,1

fair enough doesnt seem like theres any perfect way to handle it,1
 a what are you suggesting is wrong with the question,1
looks pretty much defined to me,1
what will be the length of array containing n numbers  well n,1
n elements or alength elements,1
n arrays are of a fixed size,1
if the size of an array is undefinedhttpwwwthefreedictionarycomundefined you cannot get it because it is undefined however your array very well has a definedhttpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarydefined length oh and please learn about the sizeofhttpport70netnszcc11n1570html6534p2 and array and its length ie number of elements,1
sizeof in java,1
  last time i used it sizeof was a valid c operator i see java and c tag perhaps op should add some other languages too  just for decoration,1
   oops i missed the c tag  not used to seeing both c and java tags for the same question,1
  me too but as given it can be any so op should clarify once he actually knows what he is asking but that seems to be another fireandforget question,1
after all the jesting i can inform that printfarray a length is dn sizeof a  sizeof a0 will do the job at least in c its exactly the same with b but note that i changed the narrative from size to length having said that my puzzlement about the comment size of the array may change addingdeleting elements turned to wonder even mirth since it is a fixed size array  how can you possibly keep track of its usage without another variable holding that information,1
this looks like a perfectly good question although a duplicate  of httpsstackoverflowcomquestions37538howdoideterminethesizeofmyarrayincnoredirect1lq1,1
no this is the kind of thing you do like every day,1
  i guess it depends on your workflow  in my approach i never use the index directly  when i want to save my work i just do full commits with git commit a  when i was answering this question it was because i had done an exotic inverse cherry pickhttpstackoverflowcoma162472486967 which puts files in the index for you but i wanted to edit a file before committing  i took the file out of the index while i edited it so that diffs would work the way that im used to,1
my usage case was very narrow and useless indeed create a branch add folder filled with files for branch only switch to master merge ops added wrong folder to master add it to gitignore files would not be removed from commit  granted a better solution would be just using rm straight away but i first thought switching branches wouldnt kill the ignored folder but i do use github gui based tool thats good enough for me and do support some index management except it doesnt support this so what should i use 2 guis for narrow usage still cant agree with answer,1
  i dont know about other platforms but on typical linux distros it is trivial to install these bonus gui tools  and they may come in handy for other purposes too  in any case this is just another option for people who prefer a visual approach,1
just to clarify my above comment  in the answer i suggested two tools that each support this capability  you would only need to use one of them  as a rule i am a fan of using gui toolshttpsgitscmcomdownloadguilinux with git  why would you want to manage a daghttpsenwikipediaorgwikidirectedacyclicgraph such as that created by git without the aid of visualization tools  by the way gitkhttpsgitscmcomdocsgitk and gitguihttpsgitscmcomdocsgitgui are moreorless standard equipment with git,1
this is a decidedly unpopular answer  however im quite sure that the approach i suggest is the right one for some people myself included  i use one of these tools to manipulate the index a few times per year,1
an alternative brute force approach perform a commit followed by an undohttpsstackoverflowcoma16175525,1
this guide repeatedly suggest the use of gitgui for working with the index why the indexstaging area is so usefulhttpgitolitecomusesofindexhtml,1
i would say stdstring in string,1
in python 3 the default str supports unicode which makes it quite different from stdstring,1
  stdwstring then,1
 žius there is no built in support for unicode in c  even the higher width character strings are problematic  if you need unicode in c it is best to use a library,1
  in what way does stdstring not support unicode,1
  libiconvhttpwwwgnuorgsoftwarelibcmanualhtmlnodegenericcharsetconversionhtmlgenericcharsetconversion does a pretty good job when character conversion is necessary,1
πάνταῥεῖ which reinforces my comment of best to use a library,1
  stdstringélength  2 theres no notion of encoding in a stdstring which makes it very different from pythons str,1
  which reinforces my comment of course and it was meant so as far i can see that library can be made working on serveral platforms,1
  okay i thought you were referring to the often repeated confusion that you need a wide character string to store unicode yeah youll need external functions in order to deal properly with code points but you can of course as you appear to know store unicode strings in stdstring,1
  and you can store images in stdstring but this is not supported – as unicode is not,1

  according to why is voting importanthttpstackoverflowcomhelpwhyvote you should downvote if a post contains wrong information is poorly researched or fails to communicate information please explain for which one of these reasons youve downvoted this answer,1
  two things 1 you are never owed an explanation for downvotes though i understand it can be helpful 2 i did not downvote your answer but i would guess that people dont like your answer because they think it is the wrong way to do this that would qualify it as wrong information since the question is looking for the best way to do something,1
i did not downvote you but i can certainly understand how invent yet another poorly specified format which is basically what youre saying would be seen as wrong or poorly researched,1
as others pointed out there is no standard for dates in json there is only rfc 3339 which is actually a timestamp format not a date format in particular it doesnt cover time zones but thats important for future dates time zones change more often than you might think,1
  it does cover time zones  the z indicates the time zone is utc  id downvote too but at this point theres no further need,1
  utc is not really a time zone there is no place on earth which uses utc as its official time zone its a time standardhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicoordinateduniversaltime also time zone offsets are quite unpredictable there is no way to say if in 2025 1200 moscow time is still 900 utc like it is today it has been changed a couple of times during the last 30 yearshttpsenwikipediaorgwikimoscowtimepastusage if you want to express a future local time you need true time zones,1
the mathsqrthttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysystemmathsqrt28vvs11029aspx methods returns a double so that definitely contains the fractional part of the result how are you using it,1
it returns a double lets see what code youre running are you casting the result to an int,1
decimal is not desktop hardwares capability you need to convert it from float or double to decimal but some special cpu architecture may have ability of fixed point arithmetics in which case you need to implement your own sqrt,1
this question has several answers here httpstackoverflowcomquestions4124189performingmathoperationsondecimaldatatypeinc,1
the duplicate is not appropriate since the question has now clearly nothing to do with the decimal type reopening so a better decision can be made,1
you are converting to int32 which truncates the decimal places,1
youre clearly converting the result of the mathsqrt to an int32  an integer ie no decimals,1
  you should use int instead of int32 and i cant see what for you need the decimal when dealing with ints also converting the c value to int will loose precision in most cases i suggest to used double for c,1
did you run it and find out did you run it i a debugger what confuses you,1

why do you care about memory allocation what is your question,1
there is plenty of information available regarding the java memory model on this site and elsewhere please read that and show some research effort before asking fundamental questions,1
only new allocates memory on the heap a new object variables hold a kind of pointer 4 bytes referencing that heap object hence a1 and a2 share the single object,1
"  horn how is the referencing being done 
i mean in c we create a pointer variable to store an address so basically we have a memory slot to store address
where as here without any memory being allocated how is the referencing being done actually",1
  memory is always allocated whenever you declare a variable read references or create and object using new keyword,1
but isnt it different in case of object  that we require to use new keyword before getting memory allocated for the object,1

thishttpsdocsoraclecomjavasetutoriali18nformatsimpledateformathtml is the first result when i google how to output java date format as 060115 everything you need to know is there please use google or search first if you have some code and it isnt working please add it to the question through an edit,1
if basenamefile  xxxphp huh why is that semicolon in there in the question title is that part of the real code if so thats an end of execution character statement,1
 ii sorry about that you can see the original code in the first code block,1
adding echo basenamefile to the script might be helpful,1
have you tried anything please show your code,1
not entirely sure what you are asking but did you look at the official manual,1
have a look over httpphpnetmanualenlanguageoop5visibilityphphttpphpnetmanualenlanguageoop5visibilityphp,1
which part are you able to write are you able to write a python function that obtains a parameter and displays it whats missing then,1
do you have to use recursion,1
i am receiving the some past xxxxx date from server using that date and my current date i am calculating the how many days back the question is posted other date is current date,1
no youre not all you are doing is trying to turn a date into a string and right back into a date moreover that is not how you do date math if you want to know the difference in days between two dates do not use nsdateformatter at all  do date math,1
"nsstring temp  outputdateformatter stringfromdateotherdate
otherdate  outputdateformatter datefromstringtemp                      sorry forget about the last two lines those are unnecessary lines",1
it doesnt matter i repeat to do date math you should not be using nsdateformatter at all the only thing you need nsdateformatter for is to turn the date string from the server into a date,1
can you suggest me what to do exactly i want to convert server time utc to my current device based time,1
you do not need to convert any times an nsdate is an nsdate,1
in other words just do the first part of your code and stop you now have the date now do date math,1
this might be a way to fix them but it certainly isnt the only way,1
i managed to fix a similar problem without doing git clone and starting again which meant that i kept my branches and commits see my answer httpstackoverflowcoma308720271737957,1
you could achieve the same thing by replacing the for loop with out    joinsentencesn,1
mescalinum is right the foor loop is bad form bad style and results in an incorrect string that has to be chopped off when printing  that would be a great improvement even though using randomsample is still superior,1
oncreate is fine but it depends what you need just make sure it is after setcontentview or they will return null since you are starting out i would stick with that until you understand the framework better,1
as rule of thumb always after setcontentview and the methods call has to be in a method,1

hello and welcome to stackoverflow please take some time to read the help page especially the sections named what topics can i ask about herehttpstackoverflowcomhelpontopic and what types of questions should i avoid askinghttpstackoverflowcomhelpdontask and more importantly please read the stack overflow question checklisthttpmetastackexchangecomq156810204922 you might also want to learn about minimal complete and verifiable exampleshttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,1
what does not works fine mean,1
mayhap the video file is too big  check your error logs,1
its very unclear task please specify what kind of files you are triing to upload,1
to answer your question in the way you ask it  let the user save the video as file and then you will see it works for video too,1
theres no relation between your code and youtube,1
when i try to upload mp4 filebrowser shows me snap error,1
i want to store youtube videohow would i do it,1
how about trying this download a video of less than 2 mb and check if it is uploaded,1
  shewale it worked for 2mb file thanksbt if user want to upload online videowhat changes should i do in code,1
i suggest you to ask another question for the that for your current question i will post an answer,1
go through the documentation check the auth component,1
err so whats your question,1
did you try httpsdocspythonorg2librarytkinterhtml,1
i did not thank you,1
and this was compiled o what with what other command options  btw a 2 increase in memory usage speed is wiped out by the fact you are using a on2 sort,1
have you tried different optimization options,1
thats o0 code even on o1 that whole function compiles to 21 instructions using a linaro 1311 build of gcc 483 in my experience if you mention anything about how stupid unoptimised assembly output looks to a gcc engineer you get the response well what did you expect and a withering stare of disapproval,1
i didnt try different optimization options ill try later thank you,1
please construct a minimal testcasehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,1
check if the argument of sqrt is not negative,1
as an aside instead of using those macros why not just write real functions perhaps with constexpr and id use abs instead of the mod macro,1
   square of sum of two numbers is always non negative i guess and i am trying to improve,1
  squarex  xx should be squarex  xx if you really want defines,1
ok  please vote to close ,1
obviously not what the op was asking for and even this code could be improved to the extent where it is just one line no loops ie return atolowercaseindexofb1,1
variable counter isnt even used,1
try to compile it and see for yourself,1
ctr  1 is ctr  1 eg positive one not add one to ctr,1
it is not an equal sign it is the assignment operator  in java the equals sign is  as use for boolean and logical statements,1
those are two different operations,1
you are closing the string at index 5 if you want to have the  character in your string you need to escape it,1
your string is lp and there it ends the rest  w does not belong to the string anymore,1
sorryi didnt get you exactly,1
azd  post some valid and invalid examples,1
what language following characters excluded anywhere  so every other character is allowed sounded like only uppercase letters and numbers were allowed sample input expected output and issues youve encountered would help this question,1
any character not listed is allowed can be anywhere in the string,1
try azds,1
try posting your code for starters,1
can you post your code and error what you are getting i think you are not written public static void mainstring args method this is the main method which is executed first means execution starts from here only,1
thats because java programs have to have a main method  its likely that bluej allows you to run snippets of code instead of forcing you to write an entire program,1
bluej probably wraps your code in a main methodin java you need a main method to run code,1
“i am new to java and programming“ is not a good headline try something more declarative eg something with main bluej and eclipse,1
you missed  in require testphp try require testphp,1
in addition use an ide it will solve half of these syntax errors i mean it wont solve it for you but it will highlight it for you,1
you could sprit your string into characters xor each individual character and then combine them into new string,1
thanks sir how can i split the characters please tell the code,1

it will be something like for int i  0 ixlengthi newpass xiencienclength ,1

  the op made the mistake of tagging with two different languages your comment applies completely to c but the second half is wrong in c not your problem but the ops also i tend to avoid the parenthesis in sizeof which are not needed for values but are needed for types if in code i see parenthesis i remove them it either builds or has to be changed ptr  malloc sizeof ptr   ,1
re c not even remotely equivalenthttpstackoverflowcomquestions4255598deletevsdelete this shouldnt be tagged c,1
  sir with all due respect is that a vaild dupe can you please recheck it seems op already knows the fundamental of allocation but his q was regarding deallocation which is not covered in the linked q thanks,1
  c is just c with classes,1
  ughpleasedont say that they are two different languages and better treated that way just having the same type of syntax does not make two languages atpar,1
  hey at least your nametag matches your beliefs,1
in c you shouldnt mix newmalloc and deletefree on some platforms and for some data types they behave differently and youll get strange behavior its safest to use only one throughout your program,1
  he said im tagging this with c because the above can be equivalently considered with new and delete so i say watch out theyre not equivalent,1
theres  lot of noise here about c or c this is irrelevant the premise of the question is wrong in both languages and is wrong for mallocfree as well as newdelete as well as newdelete,1

ya exactly i agree with you but i try to make this happen thank for your tips i will remember things you said when developing thank you again for your consideration,1
edit your question to include the code you tried please,1
it should still contain all items of repeating sequence,1
when you say shortest common subsequence not substring what is the distinction youre trying to make and the next phrase contains all the items in the subsequence makes it sound like youre talking about a subset ignoring order not a subsequence so… can you define exactly what youre looking for,1
also if 255 7 0 0 is in a subsequence in your sense of 255 5 6 7 0 why isnt 255 also a subsequence and an obviously shorter one,1
finally i tried longest common subsequence… why did you try that getting the longest common subsequence obviously isnt going to do the right thing if you want the shortest common subsequence if you can explain the thought process that made you think lcs would be helpful it might help us understand the problem for comparison imagine you wanted to find min and you knew how to find max you might try to negate all the numbers find the max then negate it but get stuck somewhere on the way did you think you were on the track for a similar solution to get scs from lcs,1
  yeah in every one of ops examples what op is calling the shortest common subsequence is actually the longest one,1
  isnt the longest one the entire sequence or at least half the sequence if with common he means repeated,1
  ok that actually clarifies things a lot  were not working with the python definitions for string and sequence but some other definitions,1
  yeah at least thats what i assume btw do you see his desired output for the gibberish example i just see the sentence end abruptly right before id expect the output,1
  naa it isnt there  i think he means 255 7 0 0 though given the first paragraph,1
i am not sure whether it should be called short or long subsequence but the goal is to find the repeating subsequence that contains all the items that are being repeated not the whole sequence obviously the lcs will return the whole sequence in the first choice and the repeating sequence minus the gibberish in the second choice but it is still greedy would someone also explain why i got 6 minus points on my question it has not been asked before and it is a genuine question thanks for your help,1

0formatexitcode makes string that in place of 0 put exitcode just use if candyname  exitcode
 means is left equal to right but you want to change its value use  instead",1
thank you   that solved it that was a noobie mistake for sure does anybody have a solution to the x problem it just repeats the input question after the exit message,1
see my updated answer below,1
its a good idea to tag your questions with the python version youre using as i mention below there are important differences between python 2x and python 3x in the way the input function works,1
also please dont put stuff like please help me quick this is important in your questions having that stuff in your question probably earned you a few downvotes try to write your questions so that theyll not only help you but will also be helpful to future readers to make your question most useful to others its good if you can isolate your problems so each question focuses on one problem if you have 2 problems write 2 questions of course sometimes its not easy to isolate problems like that but youll get a better response here if you try to make that effort,1
then its a better fit for codereviewse nevertheless my main objection is to the phrasing of the request,1
there doesnt appear to be an actual question in this though,1
that was my answer its incorrect so i need help solving it,1
it is not really python code check httpstackoverflowcomquestions17330160howdoesthepropertydecoratorwork,1
oh sorry missed the indention ill fix that,1
i really dont want someone to do my homework for me ive been trying for more than an hour to solve only this question but no luck so thats why i need help to know whats causing it to say its wrong,1
could you clarify your question,1
add more content to your question,1
try to narrow down what causes the error  for your own good and for everyone elses,1

  please do not suggest this formatting the string directly would make their code vulnerable,1
  true just answering the question,1
  no sense in providing vulnerable solutions to problems even if one had best intentions ,1
this doesnt sound like a great book honestly why use a while loop to reverse a string when you can use slicing or reversed why use slicing to split the string into first and last names when you can use split if youre having a hard time it might just be because theyre making you do assignments in a roundabout way,1
as i am reading through my book i was wondering why they are using a while loop for that as well and it does not explain anywhere how to use a while loop in that manner,1
  im more worried because of the assign  to a string maybe its not a python book,1
  it could be that the author is going through how other languages do it and then look how much easier it is to do in python which is probably not the most efficient style but hey i didnt write the book either,1
what is wrong id start with the formatting,1
you either need string instances with those names or you need to put the values between quotes tom to tell the compiler they are string literals,1
the program is still not workingeven if i type a name given in the array the output is unsuccessful,1
have a look at my answers second paragraph dont use ai  s but aiequalss instead  will require the objects to be exactly the same instances which is not true in your case because you have a literal and a string instance created from input the are equal but not exactly the same objects,1
thank u everyone,1
before i make my answer are you puzzled only about the vector part or is that for loop confusing you as well,1
actually both loop is something where i dont know which index program in accessing by using idx and in vector related loop i have tried to colour the image but its dead slow its like 10 pixels in one second so i wonder if i was doing the right thing or not as you can see the commented code this commented sections are basically my understanding regarding that cpp code,1
"from what i just read whatershed gives you an image with marker for each pixel its basically numbers identifying blobs its the marker mat 

to color the output they use a look up table lut giving the color you should apply given the maker number thats the part

oops  im a bit of a push   i guess p    onin  if you want to continue to be part of stackoverflow you should try to improve your question more clearly formulate your requirements have a clear and relevant titlesubject that connects your problem to some general programming questiontechnique and at least make an attempt to solve it in this case with perl,1
welcome to stack overflow time complexity on what exactly can you please clarify your question what is your problem what is your variables what is your result values and what values you expected actually please read faq ask and help as a start,1
actually it is multiplication of two large numbers the num1 num2 take numbers as input  and result is display on console so i want to know what is time complexity for above function,1
if you are looking for bigo notation i believe this is o1 since the complexity is not determined by the amount of data input into the algorithm that is the algorithm will take a specific amount of time no matter what is passed in for the two input variables httpenwikipediaorgwikitimecomplexity,1
definitely o1,1
sure there is a column createdat in subscriptions table,1

why would it return a new value over and over do you understand what a return statement is and does,1
  i believe i do but since we have a while loop i got confused since the condition of the while loop is still true therefore i was  expecting the the body of the while loop to get executed over and over,1

what is the data type of pass in c code this could be a problem with using the wrong size of variable and it wrapping,1
the c calc is wrong,1
you havent shown the definition of pass in your c code so its hard to be sure but from the looks of things your right answer depends on its being a 32bit type and its something larger than that,1
if you reverse the order of operations which is really easy with this algorithm you find that the c result of 33059234775 correctly reverses to 3 the c result however does not i would investigate the c powpass 30 line,1
"both are declared as a long

thanks for ur answer but thats somehow strange cuz as said the result in c gets accepted as a working password and the one in c doesnt work lol",1
  ps no its not do the math by hand 339 9236 36363646656 466562346679 466794667970822433059234775 oh look this by hand result is the same as the c result your c is wrong probably on the line i indicated or in datatype,1
  if your c value is what was used to calculate the original password then that would be why,1
i now changed the pow function to pass  pass  pass  pass and it gives shows me the same result as before any other ideas whats wrong,1
  have you even attempted to debug it step through the programmes calculation linebyline and compare what value is there vs what should be i gave you all the answers above and do note i recommend you secure this value as anyone who has the source everyone can easily reverse the steps,1
its an external program this code is used for and thats the algorithm i got out of it i just dont understand why the c code is wrong when calculated manually but gets accepted and the c code which is correct doesnt work at all,1
long in c is 64 bit long in c may be 32 or 64 bit 33059234775 is way out of range for a 32 bit long,1
you understand that powpass 30 returns a double right if you are using c11 try just putting powpass 3l and see if it works,1
also   is spot on in a 32bit unsigned environment that value would be interpreted as 2994463703 you should really improve this algorithm,1
"as said this is a external program and is not from me it was coded for testing purpose i just debugged both and they give back the same result after this calculation is done pass  pass  pass  708224
thats where they seperate this has to be some big luck that the wrong calculation is actually working o

i guess the one who coded this made the same mistake somewhere and thats why its working",1
i think insert into  not use set statement use values instead,1

  i am going to get the question marks from post am i making some logic mistakes,1
datetime always contains a time component there is no way to store just a date in there you can create a new datetime using the constructor datetime dt  new datetimeyear month day but it will contain the time at midnight,1
try looking at msdn on the datetime for examples of what other properties you can access this pretty straight forward in regards to the documentation,1
explain why you really need it explain what you need it for you have an xy problem x being why you need this and y being i know ill use a datetime without time the latter is impossible a datetime always has a time part so please explain your original problem x and im sure theres an easier solution perhaps datetimetostringstring format will do what you want,1
what is wrong with datetime dt  datetimenowdate,1
its because of how datetime is stored in memory its the number of ticks 100nanosecond units since the datetime epoch which is january 1 0001 at 000000000 since the underlying value is actually a time the value is always itself a time,1
do you just want date dt  datedate,1
yes i want dt hold only date not datetime,1
again you cant explain why you want that,1
"then do something like this its so simple 
var date  datetimenowdate
 var dt  datetoshortdatestring return what you are looking for as a string",1
  what are you talking about it returns the date only he doesnt want the time,1
  op is asking for a datetime you give them a string that may be what they need but it isnt what theyre asking for,1
i know what hes asking for the problem is the op doesnt understand the datetime structure ,1
why are you using byte b  alength why didnt you use int b or var b,1
are you saying that visual studio shows the length as 0x0a when you hover over alength in the editor,1
"your code does not even compile i changed it to byte a   0x0a 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x09 0x01 
            int b  alength and it returns b  10 as expected",1
are you sure this is c array declaration  must be placed after the type byte not the identifier a this isnt c,1
"how did you even compile that
you should declare array as byte a and you cant just assign int to byte",1
there are either too many possible answers or good answers would be too long for this format please add details to narrow the answer set or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphsi would suggest that you find a development forum perhaps quorahttpwwwquoracomcomputerprogramming to work out generalities then when you have specific coding issues come back to stackoverflow and well be glad to help,1
please give us your attempts at completing this task we are not your personal team of programmers,1
what does your array look like,1
but think this if the method is not allow to create parent if parent not exists does it throw an exception,1
please add at the very least  add examples of the parent directories youb claim are being created you could use your watch program to advise you,1
a small combination of directorygetparenthttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysystemiodirectorygetparentvvs110aspx and directoryexistshttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysystemiodirectoryexistsvvs110aspx should be trivial to implement,1
no this is imprecise since no parents need exist eg folder ctest exists and ctestthisisthefoldertomake does not exist there is no other way then recursively walking up that long path checking each time because those paths none of them exist then making them one at a time before then doing that final check you mention i am asking if there is an easier way to try to make it then recursion only if it fails,1
not to my knowledge but it should be easy to make one using the two functions i highlighted  there is no need for recursion just get the parent of the one you want to create  if the parent exists call directorycreatedirectory  if it doesnt dont call it  then it wont create all the missing ones  if that isnt what you need please edit your question for more clarity,1
also please dont assume that people commenting on your question diddidnt downvote or upvote your question  voting is deliberately anonymoushttpmetastackexchangecomquestions95603whyarevotesanonymousletsmakewiththetransparencyandhavethempublicly,1
its not easier because i have to do it in reverse because of the manual temporary opt out has to be sent in the correct order to send to the watcher to stop it watching  additionally the directory always does not exist,1
how does a watcher and an opt out concept all of a sudden come into the picture you dont mention them anywhere in your question and to be honest i dont understand your last comment at all please be more precise,1
without the mode i asked for in the op the only way is to do reverse recursion over the non existent paths ie in order of the shortest path not the longest path which is normal in normal recursion it is highly sub optimal when a simple flag could have accomplished it,1
the more comments i read the less i understand the question perhaps you want to solve your original problem you mentioned something with watch program and berserk not your attempt to solve it doing something weird with createdirectory,1
a google search lead to this  httpstackoverflowcomquestions5767605loopingthroughregexmatches,1
  that is a different question this question is about producing every possible match not about iterating over the matches in a given input,1
even if you eliminated special characters there are 96 trillion 8 character combinations 5416 trillion 9 character combinations etc if you were able to go through 1000 combos a second it would take you tens of thousands of years to go through just the 8 character ones,1
  maybe i could narrow it down to expressions that contain real words in the dictionary,1
theres httpscodegooglecompxeger  generates a matching input for a regex this problem however is not trivial as its entirely possible to create a regex that matches any input or that doesnt match any input,1
  that would change the question quite a bit wouldnt it you cant produce a regex that says contains real words in the dictionary there are plenty of tools out there that use dictionaries and transformations on the words in those dictionaries to attempt bruteforce attacks like this is there a reason youre not using one of those is this just an intellectual exercise,1
if hacking to account was that easy then nothing was safe,1
from the fact that there is a digit a special character and a captial we can deduce that those are all allowed as are lower case letters lets assume this is relatively insecure doesnt allow any others and only has 5 special characters allowed for the minimum size of 8 characters there are 5×10×26×5⁶⁷  8809142651×10⁴⁹ possibilities more im assuming the same order if we can manage a billion tries a second then thatd take 2791448859×10³³ years thats 2023082229×10⁴¹ times longer than the universe has been around implementing the bruteforce efficiently is not the problem,1
also if its over the web it doesnt have to be efficient even a slow algorithm producing passwords to try will have raced ahead of the actual attempts,1
i didnt find though will this work  mmm dd yyyy,1

right thats how you would do that looks like you know exactly how to write such a template,1

   yes thats what sizeof does it gives you the size of the object if you want to do something else you need to say what you want to do,1

your file arialttf is in the same location from where you are executing the program if not could your try giving the entire path access violation reading location 0x74742e6c means location you are trying to read does not exist,1
  it is where it is supposed to be i have tried using iffontloadfromfilehigher or lowerarial but it does not work httpimgurcomyevsb5g,1
the address of the access violation 0x74742e6c happens to be be the hex representation of ltt ie the characters at offsets 47 from your font name  this is almost certainly due to a mismatch between debug  release compiled files  that fact it works in release but not debug suggests that you are using the release library with your debug build,1
this is forgive me for saying it a stupid constraint and i dont see what is the benefit in acheiving it also main without a return type is very old syntax,1

oh guys cmon  why did you closed it i just wrote a solution for c ,1
i vtc because the value of such questions to the so knowledge repository is 0,1
 angel i dont know any c and didnt know that and know that i know it i dont like it i am talking about c in c that is not possible,1
 angel  it is possible to declare a variable  can you point me at the c standards section for this please,1
  i cant tell for c but i can tell for c — i leaved a link to a question in so at the comment about the possibility,1
 angel also despite the tags the posted code does not have any c so i assumed that c was the implementation language,1
  the title mention three languages ☺ but okay i got you,1
 angel the accepted answer implies en exclusiveor for definition or expression for this question it would result in the expression after the  being the initializer i do not see much sense in 0  expression either which might be the problem for c,1
  sorry but i didnt get you ☹ in the answer no xor and i dont see the 0  expression i assume that you meant the code int n0  scanfdn … inside the question then it isnt what you thought — the idea is that the variable n being declared without a semicolon which is a constraint of the puzzle,1
this can be done in java if needed in a different manner than what is mentioned in answer below  hope they are not asking these at interviews these days anyway question is closed so answer,1
 angel reworded yes iobviously refer to that line the accepted answer implies either definition or expression for this question it would result in the expression after the  being the initializer for n i do not see much sense in 0  whatever expression either which might be the problem for c for the reset it is very well what i thought and i can read,1
  i still couldnt get you but ill try to answer «the accepted answer implies either definition or expression» → the answer uses a hack that allows to write any code that would use semicolon ie allows both definition and expression «for this question it would result in the expression after the  being the initializer for n» → as i see op wanted to declare a varible then use it in expression ie if we couldnt write an expression or definition an answer would be impossible,1
«i do not see much sense in 0  whatever expression either» → no it is not just zero in the code on the left side it is a variable declaration and the declared variable being used next on the right side,1
 angel so it would not work read the accepted answer to the question you inked again it is either a declaration or an expression for here the whole part right of   is the initializer and as boolean opeartors uses shortcircuit evaluation only the 0 part is actually evaluated and assigned to n this is what happens so consider the first term was not 0 the the scanf would be evaluated changing nhowever finally the whole result of the boolean expression would be used to initialize n overwriting the value from scanf,1
  ahhh now i see ☺ so you meant the accepted answer in the link not the one here as i thought okay so for the first everything inside of ifstatement being evaluated in an order ie the n indeed would hold zero then accept a number of user next print it as about a zero… well here it is if int n  0  scanfdn  printfdnn  else ifscanfdn  printfdnn  it works and no semicolon were harmed for this code ,1
 angel have a look at operator preceedencehttpencppreferencecomwcpplanguageoperatorprecedence you are wrong here preceedence is not given by missing whitespace around the assignment operator also read about logical boolean operator evaluationhttpport70netnszcc11n1570html6513p4 basically the same for c and c once one of the inclusiveorexpression s fails the rest is not evaluated anymore so after the 0 fails the rest is not even evaluated anymore,1
  in the code that i posted after the zero fails being executed an else statement besides i checked that it works before posting,1
 angel it might become more clear if i add parenthesis they do not change preceedence however int n0  scanfdn  printfdn is actually int n   0  scanfdn  printfdn  it is not int n0  scanfdn  printfdn note that the latter would be a logicalorexpression with a definition please point me where this is allowed,1
  you havent read the code i posted yes the int n0 part fails it does and after that happens execution goes to the else branch and there i use exactly the same variable that i defined in the first failing branch,1
 angel ok sorry this time i did overlook your code however that is still not ideal as the rest of the if condition after th 0 ist actually just decoration and never executed for the reasons i gave already problem is that printf is executed if scanf either fails due to eof or has read the value properly what is the point in the 0  part note that n is always 1 if no error occured due to printf returning  0 i exclude error conditions otherwise 0,1
 angel so what about if  int n  scanfdn  1  printfdn  0  this allow even error handling to some extend but still not c,1
  yes it is better and it works too i checked ☺,1
 angel i know it does thought you might get the idea yourself actually still this is just a stupid without the  constraint just leads to writing unreadable code wihout any gain in knowledge,1
have you given it any thought yourself yet how many times is the function executed for n being 0 or 1 how many times for n being 2 can you extrapolate from there how many times itd be executed for any given n how much memory is used per call,1
i have given it so thought but i dont understand how to get answer the run time complexity is 2n and so would the memory be the same,1
  where did you get o2n that is not correct,1
since youre asking for the memory consumption how much memory is stored in each scope theres only one local variable the argument so that is o once you know that how deep does the callstack go given that you know n is decremented by 1 each time and the recursion stops when you reach 0 integrate the amount of memory in each scope along the number of scopes callstack depth and you have your answer,1

edit your question to do the following 2 things 1 explain what write it to a new column means and 2 post a few more lines of sample input includes cases you think will be hard to deal with and the associated expected output i suspect when you say in your comment append a new column at the end of the same file you really mean append a new column to the end of each line but idk maybe you really do want to add one column at the end of the file whatever that means,1

httpswwwwebsitecomutmsourcegoogleutmmediumcpcutmcampaignifsearchs443ozgnfpcridcreativepkwkeywordpmtmatchtypeutmtermkeywordnetworknetworkpositionadpositiondevicetypedevice

so im looking to pull out 443ozgnf and write it to a new column",1
  your best bet would be to find a module that can parse the arguments to the query for you it is a really bad idea to change  to   the string is already delimited by ,1
httpstackoverflowcomquestions12425393perlparseurltogetthevalueusing,1
it wasnt delimited by  it was delimited by other characters which is why i did a find and replace so that i would have a common delimiter  ive just written a ruby script as the solution,1
the program always receives at least 1 argument which is the programs name,1
why didnt you output the values of argv  that would have answered your own question,1
"because i did not knew that the values are stored here
as you can read in my question how can i find out the filenames of the arguments",1
the argument may be a filename if thats what you pass in  but its still just an argument print it like any other variable you dont need to find the filename of a variable to see whats in there,1
why did this question get so many downvotes the only fault i see is the question being very basic but it explains what the inquirer has tried so far and even provides even a minimal example,1
i also dont understand the downvotes  there is not even feedback so i can learn what i can improve in my next question maybe some trolls are on this site,1
  maybe the research effort was not enough  if you know what argc is but wasnt in the least bit curious as to what the argv sitting right next to it means maybe those downvotes are warranted,1
lol marked as duplicate even when i explained why it is no duplicate,1
the answer on the other question explains what argc and argv are and that  virtually all implementations will prepend the name of the program to the array it is a duplicate because you can find answers to all your questions there and there is no need for so many answers repeating the same thing,1
thats like saying read this c book all is explained there,1
in the last example shouldnt the output be 000 ,1
with a mindiff  posdiff  negdiff  20 instead of your mindiff code part i get 007 btw do you want c or c,1

  why are the positive and negative differences being averaged c please,1
  calculation not averaged but halfed first the necessary money flow is the sum of dfferences to the average splitting it in two sums doesn´t matter at all but then each cent payed from person a to person b affects both so 2 c you should rewrite your whole program,1
  facepalm,1
remove the cast to long — youre deliberately throwing away precision or better yet dont use floating point at all,1
you mean like rm rf  or     as long as you do not fry the disk there is no way to prevent a recovery by disk forensics please clarify exactly what scenarios you want to destroy,1
what do you mean by without any chance of recovery,1
without chance of recovery and at the same time under 100ns is technically impossible recovery is possible as long as the disk is not damaged in an unrecoverable way and this requires at the very least one syscall taking 100ns alone and a disk access,1
personally i wonder whats the reason for this since it looks like black hat question,1
have you considered throwing it in a volcano  thats likely to fit your time criteria as well,1
it wont reboot again  i am looking for a solution where the resources of the node will be recovered but not the internal state of the node it is just a way to reduce the implementation afford by just saying if it behaves fishy consider it gone,1
and since this will put silent failure to become a normality it solves almost all failure scenarios to just reboot and a reboot takes under two to three seconds nowadays so i do not care,1
so do you want the system to shut down start having oslevel errors or crash within 100ns  im familiar with shooting the node in the head the actual expression but this question is still very poorly worded,1
correct i want an instant crash within 100ns so i am looking for a way to force the cpu to restart the system rather than the os in ancient times there were op codes for instant that triggered the cpu to restart the system instead of doing interrupt dancing,1
also you are right with the poorly worded stuff ,1
i rewrote your question im near certain this is what you meant,1
nope its not making it unresponsive actually is forcing it to crash and instantly reboot,1
i rewrote the question i guess it is now crystal clear what is ment ,1
so docker kill or lxcstop k nowait is too slow,1
the crash is triggered by the application itself any execution of a process or what ever is too slow,1

you have ub and code which seems to work enter in undefined behavior too ,1
  it would be better if you could say what c standard says about this,1
  who downvoted why downvotes whats wrong in my question,1
  im definitely no language standards junkie but my guess is the language doesnt say anything about this its not typical for a specification to tell you the things youre not supposed to do  especially those things nobody in their right mind would ever intentionally do without expecting badness to result,1
  the language says explicitly that this is ub youre mostly right about that in general though,1
 t 1 for writing about the standard section 54911 in your answer,1
i didnt downvote but those who did may have done so because this question is silly why would you expect invoking a function yfoo on an unrelated object of type x to have welldefined semantics its selfevidently nonsensical,1
 t you are right but i just wanted to know whether it leads to ub or not,1
what else could it possibly do,1
 t fair enough and good that it does just that i wouldnt expect it to say so in all ub cases and since this is a fairly obvious case of ub i wouldnt have expected it here,1
  i concur i was pleasantly surprised ,1
you forget to execute the query i think mysqlquery,1

no errors but it is not getting inserted into database,1
i think it may be helpful for you to read up on sqlinjectionhttpstackoverflowcomq60174448591 if you havent heard of it yet,1

  i need an object by which i can call method of tform1 class right ,1
tell me one thing when i create a form using below code why form1 is nil  if it is nil how to call tform1s method on some other button click event if needed  code with tform1createself do begin try showmodal finally free end end after this code the form tform1 is created now form1 is showing as nil now whats next stuff ,1
instead of giving nonproductive suggestion if you have any solution for below code when form1 is nil what would you do if you tell that would be productive i think nobody knows about this and just trying to beat around the bush by giving nonuseful comments this form creation code is not written by me so just wanted to know if you dont know atleast respect yourself and dont give any suggetion for your sake code with tform1createself do begin try showmodal finally free end end after this code the form tform1 is created now form1 is showing as nil whats next stuff,1
simply reference to self instead of form1 as others have said why form1  nil is hard to say applicationcreateform isnt called and youve created your own instance of tform1 perhaps  borland should never introduce those global variables im deleting them personally they are useless,1
  another thing you should keep in mind is that people here are trying to help you not to put you off,1
   well said  lets hope you can get through where others have failed,1

welcome to the site ashok please read the guidelines on asking questions to get more answers your question is currently very difficult to read or make sens of and is therefore being downvoted if you take the time to write good  clear concise questions more people will answer,1

  could you please share what have you tried so far i mean some code examples so that we understand what you are trying to achieve,1
i am confused about this some one  says php is frontend and someone says php is backend what is right,1
  no confuse php is a language to handle database like mysql it is called as backend language for clear idea just read php documentation or this link httpwwwquoracomwhichprogramminglanguagesarefrontendandwhichonesarebackend,1
thanks friend now i understood,1
is the cc syntax that obtuse  in short  you need ifstuff  a  stuff  b  stuff  c also for your next question please make sure to craft a minimal example all of these printfs are unrelated to the question,1
choice 1  3  10 evals to true you shall grab a textbook first,1
change you code from choice1310 to choice 1  choice  3  choice  10,1
  so what if i shuffle the order if i input 3 10 1 instead of 1 3 10 wasnt able to execute the whats inside of its if statement,1
that is quite probably the most horrible indenting i have seen for years  choice1310 assigns one to choice throws away the 3 and returns 10 as a value which is unlikley to be what you want,1
your whole approach is wrong  the details are also wrong the  operator does not mean anything similar to what you have assumed  but you should fix the basic design before revisiting any question of syntax details  you need to use a lot more thought and less code  good programming involves generalizing related situations so they can share common code not individually detecting and handling each unique situation,1
in this case order in the if statement doesnt not matter both the statements  ifchoice  3  choice  1  choice  10  and if choice  10  choice  1  choice  3  are same,1
  however the user does have to do that test for all 3 of choice1 choice2 choice3,1
  yes user has to do that i dont disagree with that,1
i have many cases to be followed so i just showed here the case for choosing 139 or 1310 or 1311 each of the three has different equations to be solved inside their if statement if i choose 1 and 3 and 10 together then it will execute its statement if i choose 1 and 3 and 11 then it will execute a different one so my problem is what if i input 3 10 1 instead of 1310 because the code i have is ifchoice1  choice2 3  choice310,1
  tried using switch but i will be repeating case 1 all over because i have a combination of 1 3 9 1 3 10 and 1 3 11,1
  in the case of switch you can have  nested switches with switch code looks much better and eliminate redundant lines,1
  im having a really hard time making sense of your question but from what i gathered that question is indeed not a duplicate of this one vote retracted could you perhaps rework your question to be clearer possibly by summarizing your goal then providing an example ,1
  you can put all your print statements in a method call print output call this method whereever you wanted to print,1
thank you all now i understand,1

it is a best practice in java coding to always use  brackets for an if or an else block,1
i would strongly advise you to start using braces around your branch bodies and get an ide to format your code  then youll be able to see why your current code is invalid,1
while not strictly necessary i would advise you to always follow up an if or else with a block of  this can help avoid a lot of problems along with the ones you are currently having and some less obvious ones later,1

this community is really not beginner friendly getting all these downvotes without any explanations or guidance also thanks   i will look into that,1
what you are asking though is  far too broad based on site guidelines outlined in the help center downvotes are a measure of this questions long term usefulness to others asking about fundamentals that can be easily researched is not the objective here,1
isnt that what a help center is all about  ask question if you do not understand and as the saying goes no question is stupid and what makes you think that i havent done the research  as i said i have no formal cs background ive done some readings and i do not understand obviously im seeking knowledge and suggestions here but people that downvote without bothering to help is just ridiculous you are just deterring people from learning if i know the answers i wouldnt even bother posting here at the beginning,1

why are there so many downvotes on this post,1
dunno  im guessing at no aparrent attempt to debug,1
beginners have no idea how to do that and the guy atleast showed some effort his logic is a bit flawed nothing else seems wrong,1
  this question does not show any research effort is the first suggested reason to downvote a question  if you hover your mouse over the downvote button you will see that text  i suspect that the downvotes are communicating that  no evidence of research or an actual useful question,1
beginners have no idea how to do that  then they should learn when progressing beyond hello world instead of posting on so as the first option,1

i min im making answer,1
reserve changes capacity not size your intvec is like empty tank,1
why do you call 0 invalid it is completely valid for a vector to have size 0 especially if you neither want to push something into it nor init it with some size other than 0,1
could you specify what you want this code to do so we can help you,1
tongueincheek answer if you dont want to use intvecpushbackx use intvecinsertintvecend x instead more seriously you need to either preinitialise the vector to a size or add elements to it if you want it to not be empty,1
so your actually goal is making a vector with 5 uninitialized elements did i get that right,1
edited my question,1
  it seems pretty abusive to the vector why not use pushback or a 0 initalization,1
  im so confused i think maybe you want isintvecresize51,1
i think xy problem if op says what he want to achieve or why we he want such thing  we can help better,1
after edit thats not possible stdvectoroperator can only access existing elements it never changes the vectors size,1
if you want the size to be 1 after intvec0  1 it also has to be 1 before intvec0  1   theres no way around that you can intvecresize1 first if youre desparate for the indexing operator,1
  he size of the vector should be 1 after intvec0  1 no what makes you think so id recommend you first consult the reference documentationhttpencppreferencecomwcppcontainervectoroperatorat before making wild assumptions,1
this feels like an xy problem  what are you actually trying to achieve,1
i want to build a circularring buffer that is not zeroinitialized after creation ie no elements should be in the buffer immediately after creation,1
also i cant scroll my map and zoom vertically because the scroll view scroll over the map,1
i hope you referred the mentioned document thi is not a good practice to put map fragment inside the scrollview please let me know why are you doing like this any reason behind that  i have done same thing without add in scrollview if you would like to watch the code then let me inform,1
  what if you have a long form and want map in the centre of it with all functionalities wont you use scrollview then,1
no i havent yet use but without scrollview you can same feature achieved through supportmapfragment it,1
"alok you can perform or bind the touch event on google map like as  googlemapsetonmaplongclicklistenernew googlemaponmaplongclicklistener

     do your stuff here

  you didnt understand my point correctly read it again if you havent without scrollview you wont be able to scroll through a complex long xml based form for eg a long data entry form with dozens of fields one below another and one of them being a supportmapfragment maybe to enter location if you add a scrollview to the root of this layout then you can scroll the form to view all fields else you cant and now in this case the supportmapfragment wont take touch events such as scroll up and down inside map or zoom in out and so you need to do something like i answered above,1
the user doesnt want long click on map he want scrolling inside map alongwith the scroll featrue outside map in the form,1
yes i was gone through your answer actually i havent use yet this feature scroll feature outside map so i also need to check,1

ive tried performseguewithidentifiersecondviewcontroller sender nil not too sure if im missing something but its throwing up an error,1
please edit your question to include this information as well as a direct quote of the error message you are getting  i would also suggest including more context than your little sample there,1
there could be several valid ways to split the same string do you care which one is chosen,1
no i don´t care about that,1
i mean i know how to do it with the condition that the input only contains words in the dictionary  the thing is that since there are characters in the input which aren´t in the dictionary recurssion becomes very tricky to use ,1
look into tries httpenwikipediaorgwikitrie,1
yeah i actually have the dictionary implemented as a trie but i don´t know how to use it to solve the problem,1
what do you mean with the same metadata filename modification date,1
at the same time whats wrong with one then the other,1
  well that can be useful for instance if both xml and csv store the same format and that it takes a long time to calculate the elements,1
you can still calculate all the raw data then convert to csv and xml then save one then the other at the last minute if for whatever reason you want them both to be created at a similar time,1
what makes you think you cant open two at the same time var a  new streamwriterfootxt var b  new streamwriterbartxt  job done,1
when you say at the same time do you mean that they need to be written to the drive at the same instant or that they need be created together to avoid going through the streamwriter twice maybe is too big you need to be more specific about your question,1
  i think multi threading is the answer because two streamwriters cant open at the same time which possess the same thread,1
  in what way does my answer not work two streamwriters categorically can coexist though possibly not if theyre on the same file how about you post some code that you think doesnt work so we have something to go on use linqpadhttpswwwlinqpadnet and test the code i posted if you dont believe me,1
have you tried to use pathgetdirectoryname fileinfodirectory etc try to use google before asking so,1
i didnt try pathgetdirectoryname fileinfodirectory etc and also i tried google as the topic and also get folders into string etc ezi thanks for lightningi can list folder names in another place of code what i want is write them to a txt file,1

hello my intention is not to create malware it only brings my page on next browser session when user asks to set it as homepage is there a better way to do so then please let me know i will be thankful,1
if youre installing something on the users computer they should be very aware of it,1
there is no difference in security the true benefit comes from decoupling the html from the php where you can,1
  what do you mean by decoupling  to me decoupling means that the php script is in a separate file but clearly im wrong on that,1
in this case the decoupling comes from removing as much php as you can from your html code which often means separate files,1
  not sure i follow  could you please clarify  your first comment says there is no difference between these two methods but also says that there is benefit in decoupling ie using a separate file  does that mean the benefit of using a separate file is something other than security  if so what is the benefit,1
maintenance and the ability to make rapid changes to code when needed,1
  understood thanks,1
can you post your code,1
is the image variable a container and set to stretch if so you might indeed be over that stretched control despite only seeing the image in the upper left corner to figure out if that is the case dont do the dragmove and just click on that spot to see if you receive the event there,1

  the op might be confused by the lack of space between the two format specifiers the op might be a beginner and he might think that ldc is a single format specifier that he is unable to decipher an answer telling him to split this specifier into two parts ld and c would be better than rtfm this community should be more welcoming and more beginner friendly,1
 c64 please have a look at the timeline already two answers are posted after that i made the comment as long as i know a question should reflect the research efforts which this one particularly lacks,1
 c64 and by saying beginner friendly does not mean we can welcome skipping ask part,1
  with all due respect  please go ahead and close the tab,1
  sure ,1
  the fact that two answers were already posted before your comment doesnt mean anything to me to me it seems just a question from someone who is a c beginner and i think everyone of us once was,1
 c64 we all have our own viewpoint and i respect that to me i am getting confused in ldc does sound like i dont know what is meant by ldc rather than im confused not by seeing a space separator between two format specifiers is this a desired behaviour,1
actually what are you trying to achieve,1
it must be giving you stackoverflow exception,1
echo the generated sql and run it yourself in phpmyadmin or terminal and the error message you receive back will help to identify why it failed,1
it probably means you do not even open the connection to the database,1

i has open my connection before this i give this code,1
"connection  mysqlconnectlocalhostroot

try separating the query into a separate variable sql so you can echo it to the screen perhaps there is an error in it i expect it has a sql injection vulnerability in it in any case,1

what do you mean can you show us some sample output,1
you know you are ordering the converted date and i just checked it gives for today 11122013 so it means you could have 11122013 followed by 01102012 cause its a string ,1

maybe get rid of the  as well to debug,1
not working isnt an error  what error php does yield or what is the expected behaviour you do not get,1
i took out the  but im not getting any error at all and its not inserting my data into the db i dont know why i updated my post with more info,1
return node is not within a method it should probably be 2 lines higher,1
and usually eclipse wins,1
so which line is the error on  i would try to compile it myself but im not set up for whichever character set youre using and im not going to mess around with my settings just to answer this question  its probably going to get closed before i can type my answer anyway,1
thats what i expected well i want to reference the dajnasrodek method from the main method but i dont even know exactly where to put it do you at least know what i mean i can seem very unclear in that since im a beginner at programming,1
or to put it simple the method dajnasrodek means exactly center the screen and all i want to do is to make the program automatically center the screen after the startup any ideas how to do this dajnasrodek method is the algorithm i want to run but no luck so far,1
no it seems that you are describing a compile error  but all i see is code that should compile  if you want help resolving a compile error youll need to show us the code that has the error not some other piece of code that doesnt have the error,1

as  b is trying to say  it sounds like you have a different problem  you shouldnt need to initialize windows desk but find a way to stop whatever it is from killing it in the first place or something else perhaps,1
  ill explain that details the application is a startbutton installer it replaces the windows 8 startbutton and after the installation it closes the explorerexe the screen goes solid color it removes the taskbar too then if i just restart the explorerexe process the desk elements doesnt initializes it only opens a new explorer window,1
this is because i did a custom silent installer for an application that after be installed automatically closes the explorerexe iirc classicshell installs without killing explorer so perhaps do what it does  and dont kill explorer,1
 speotis thanks for comment but using classicshell replacament is not a solution for me i need to use the software that ive commented ive paid for it,1
  i didnt say use classicshell i said do what it does,1
   i think a lot of the downvote heat came from the original question which was rather unclear and insulting comments that followed not due to any unusuality,1
i really hope you cant id really like to know if an app i install is about to run up charges on my account,1

 oli charlesworth  i understand the theoretical concept  could you please explain me with c program example ,1
such interrupts are handled by the os and drivers  there is not going to be any sensiblypostable example  linux opensource  go look at some drivers,1
   an analogy  you the computer is thinking the interrupt is an idiot has poked you in the ribs with a pencil you stop what you are doing and shout an expletive that is an interrupt,1
there are some compilers for embedded systems that have extensions for c to handle interrupts but as others have pointed out these are not applicable for windows or linux,1
why just not move the script from inside your script into a separate file then not recommended for production though as it represents more bandwidth consumption aka more http requests,1

thanks wolf its ok but i want in another way thats means first one should disapper and senond one come and again i click then second one moved and third one come in this way i want,1
hello rocket hazmat now you get what i want,1
javascript object properties have no inherent order you should use array as your first attempt   httpjsfiddlenets8w5e2,1
thanks wolf now i get what i want,1
why would you do that ,1
the problem is that is error is cannot convert string to string,1
are you sure you dont mean char ,1
what do you want to accomplish,1
a string is an array which is by definition more than one string youre wanting to convert a single string to more than one string just so you are clear on what you are asking hopefully you can see why this is confusing us all,1
i just want to save it as an string because that value is of an string value if you understand but can you tell how to convert to char,1
oooh yea i see but how to save it as an char,1
is studentsponsor a string and efstudentsponsor a string  because if so you want to convert a string to string and not otherwise,1
yeaa of course you are right,1
can you give me a example or something its a bit important right now,1
what is qualitypoints and sumofhours,1
you arent converting a string to a double in this code you are converting a double to a string the fact that youre trying to convert a string to a double not double is the problem 1 for not knowing what youre talking about,1
no i know what i was converting it was a typo on my part,1
this is a key word not variable,1
whats with all the duplicates of that specific question at the moment is there a test going on somewhere or something ,1
dear lord never access your variables like that also never name your object starting upper case there are some rules for accessing data and naming conventions please read on them,1
the object you are referring to doesnt have a name yet  it is this object thats the use of it you dont know the name of the object but can call the current object with this,1
there is no such thing as the full name of an object you are confusing objects and classes,1

but im not fully sure why just test it whether is blockedwhatever that means or not,1
i couldnt test it under concurrent access like few people using the site at the same time that is why im not sure,1

theres no difference except a dramatically low parsing difference what are you expecting from the above and what are you getting,1

are you sure you screamed bug loud enough youll know you did if youre really really humiliated for proclaiming at the top of your lungs that you discovered a bug and then find out youve just failed to read the documentation properly the moral of the story never assume that youve found a bug that millions of other users never found particularly in an api function that is used so heavily internally within the os itself always know that odds are very high that the problem is in your code instead,1

you cannot apply distinct to just one column it affects the whole row so in your case it will remove the rows that are fully identical,1

what were you trying to achieve when you wrote lzakupow  new doublelzakupow what do you think this line of code should do,1
you should follow java naming conventions also classes start with a capital letter and variables are camelcase where the first letter is lower and each new word is then capital like this class someclass variable thisissomevariable,1
welcome to stackoverflow  please try to make you questions specifically about code  for example are you asking for the sql to show the three fields you listed,1
can you copy and paste that section of code also please its difficult to read,1
boolean logic for 2 simultaneous negatives needs or not andchange and to or and put the 2 conditions in parenthesis,1
you have the column is not null condition in the left join on clause not in the where thats why,1
i just uploaded it via sos available tools the original i have saved on my computer is more than good enough to read,1
post code not images,1
thought it would be easier to show the results i got and the sql in a single view with highlights for clarity no need for a public lynching,1
where is the lynching people have been trying to help you why havent you edited the question yet removing the image and posting code,1
this particular question is solvedwhen i try to mark an answer as accepted i get you can post in 2 minutes which doesnt make much sense however it brought up another question i dont know whether to make a new post or do it all through here,1
why would you do that,1
are you just asking about the return statement have you noticed any side effect whats the actual problem,1
i would assume so have you jsfiddled it are you thinking on the lines of you may not have a name yet so when you want to populate the person function you want to return nothing until the name has been set,1
you need to show us the code especially around line number 164,1
depends on how you read in the text file,1
use any loop for while do   while there are several ways to accomplish this,1
initialize cursor helps with deprecated method really,1
do you just want to append the string you have with quotes,1
just a guess lines  jsondecodelines,1
are you getting data in lines do a printr,1
lines is neither an object nor array therefore you cant iterate over it with foreach convert it properly if you dont know whats inside use vardumplines,1
"ifisarraylinesforeachlines as linenum  lineyour logic
add a check if line is an array",1
filegetcontents reads file into string not array,1
its 3 3 isnt dividable by 5 so the remainder is 3 which is what the modulo operator gives you,1
 is the modulus operator in java and many other languages  so it checks what the remainder is after you perform the division in this case what is the remainder of 35 which is 3,1
exactly how much research have you carried out,1
  in all fairness you cant use puntuation signs or things like  on google,1
i find it very hard to believe that references regarding the module operator are blocked,1
thats it stackoverflow is the search site using special charaters ,1
   fair point,1
  in all fairness if you just write 35 in the google search bar 3 pops up as an suggestion and if you click search the first result is a calculator showing 3 as an result linkhttpswwwgoogledesearchq3255ieutf8oeutf8aqtrlsorgmozilladeofficialclientfirefoxachannelsbgferdcreia2zau7h3b6yh8qe22igobgchannelsbq3255rlsorgmozilladeofficial,1
  i knew google worked as a calculator but i didnt know this it even gives the name modulo you learn every day,1
 ᴜʀᴇsʜᴀᴛᴛᴀ you can know a lot about math and still not have learned that the  infix operator is bound to the modulo operation in java,1
  glad i could help you ,1
the question is how to do this at run time with varying width content,1
so what have you tried,1
why would you want this,1
take a look at the javascript navigator object,1
the problem with this solution is that it would replace any other styles in the style attribute instead of just changingadding the width property,1
what is code what is self did you mean this,1
no its self in xcode its some kind of modified c,1
you can parse it with inbuilt json library show what youve tried so far,1
jsonobject jsonobject  new jsonobjectstr  you can start from there,1
please put your ajax script and the data it is fetching as well a sample is sufficient,1
"why do i put the cons 
this site unwelcoming",1
what is your aim,1
id be surprised if this compiles at all for instead of for fancy double quotes instead of straight quotes also java style suggests you use int x instead of int x,1
and also i dont understand this question very much  if you dont understand the question how are we meant to and surely to answer will this work you should at least see if your code compiles first,1
what do you think that line should do and why,1
what do you intend for that line to do,1
what exactly does int objectgetspawnsetusefalse mean,1
when you make an error like that the compiler tries to make sense of it  the first attempt is probably to consider int object as a declaration  it would then observe that there is no semicolon after that declaration  hence the error message,1
any comments on the downvotes,1
system returns the scripts exit code use backtickshttpwwwrubydocorgcore212kernelhtmlmethodi60 to capture the scripts output,1
i didnt downvote your question but its not clear to me what youre trying to do here  maybe you can clarify your question,1
  backticks give me  syntax error word unexpected expecting  error,1
output  ruby path should work,1
   why dont you add it as an answer,1
use a setter in your enemy class to set the reference to the player instead of initializing a new player,1
thanks  ,1
you meant to write hellohomepage right ,1
actually your code is full of errors wrong selectors etc ,1
thats what only half learning a host of languages has provided me with so i do apologise for that,1
this post does not answer the question the question is about building a release for ios using the commandline tools not the onlinebuildservice,1
thats not json,1
decode remove encode again doing string manipulation on json does not look sensible,1
whenever you have large amount of javascript code and you want to test if you have correct syntaxjson format you can use wwwjsonlintcom its a nice toolcheck it out if you have not seen it before,1
please clarify what your problem is what you tried and edit your title make it shorter and more meaningful,1
render svg on any browser generated through inskscape i tired its not working ,1

have you tried testing them please do ,1
compile it i dont think it is run it if you face exception let us know sure we will help,1
i get to both exmaples javalangnullpointerexception,1
what does sizeofarrarr mean you probably want sizeofarrsizeofarr,1
a pointer is technically an integer value where the value is the address where the pointer points to if you want eg head to point to where temp is pointing straight assignment is what you should do if you use the addressof operator you tell head to point to the temp variable and not what temp points to,1
you seem to be confusing the address of a thing and the address of a different thing the address of any object x is always x thats also true for arrays but additionally the array expression itself decays into a pointer  but a different kind of pointer it decays into the pointer to the first element thats a  different animal from the array itself so both arr and arr exist and make sense theyre just different things,1
i think  you confused between address of pointer and address pointed by pointer,1
if you feel that your question might get misinterpreted or get a too formal answer bold plus italic font wont change that…,1
  can you give me link to any video that might help me getting this concept,1
some comments about what your code does would have been helpful,1

todoitem was not what i meant sorry  i just edited todoitem to person,1
tldr condense your code down to the relevant parts,1
dont post the whole project post only relevant code,1
also your class currencydic does not even have a add method,1
youre creating a dictionary from string to dictionary the what goes here would be the string that you intend to use as the key quite possibly currencycode but only you know for sure,1
are you asking what to use as the key its a string and as   says youre not exposing an add method on your wrapper class,1
btw why does the currencydic class even exist that seems entirely unnecessary and poorly implemented,1
why would you want to change code which can perfectly use a list to using a dictionary,1
because thats what the assignment is all about,1

what is a cat suit,1
what is the content of your data file  you say that you have no idea of what youre doing but you are posting a entire class do you understand this class  did you write it  or it is a resource that a teacher let you complete to implement your program ,1
my friend and i are working on this but even she has no idea of what we should do we took the code on our handouts and also some online since its also our first time using python,1
this is pretty complex for a first exercise  you should talk to whoever gave it to you about what youre already expected to know,1
ok take a look first at httpfropenclassroomscominformatiquecoursapprenezaprogrammerenpython french version of the tutorial as you are interested in french and to httpenwikipediaorgwikitrie  then you should teel us what is in your 3 files words with meaning  words with information about such as infinite version of the word  clarify our need please and   1,1
actually i have 4 files first is for the verbes ending in er second ending in ir 3 and 4 are the suffixes for verbes ending in er ir the program must ask the user to input one word and then it should be able to tell which form it is in french for example if i will input aimerais it should have an output of aimer  conditionnel 1ère person singular sorry my english is bad in explaining,1

well thats because downloadfileasync returns void not a string and async doesnt mean its going to give you the filename it means its going to do the work asynchronously what filename do you want it to contain scoopscachehtml,1
yes scoopscachehtml or any other file name i will give but yes the downloaded file name,1
you seem to know what file name it is without having to actually download it why cant you just pull it out of this line uri uri  new urihttprotternetscoopscachehtml,1
yeah fairly sure you will be programming in c or something else,1

see what is better in calling a method creating an object or make the method statichttpstackoverflowcoma249975343453226,1
this would revert changes to the file wouldnt it,1
that particular statement is not a valid syntax and will give you an error  however its you that need to clarify with details what you are looking for,1
this statement is not even valid syntax but assuming you meant join table 1 and table 2 with valid syntax you can start here to understand joins httpblogcodinghorrorcomavisualexplanationofsqljoins,1
oh and while you are at it why not simply input this into a mysql prompt and see what happens,1
  check out joins illustrated in a very clear way all details in the linkhttpblogcodinghorrorcomavisualexplanationofsqljoins here,1
so it will print the value of the variable and not just literally b1cc,1
  will print a space in the screen,1
thanks a lot i didnt understand that  is creating a space here thats why the quotes were confusing me,1
4th or 5th time,1
print value of j if you are not able to figure out whats being added to sum,1
dont call your variable sum which is the name of a builtin function,1
you want to remove all nonzero digits show us the sample output,1
do you want to replace all series of one or more digits which are not zeroes are in range 19 with  if that is the case than why in your result there are more zeroes than at in your input,1
  its not that simple i guess note that the number of zero was changed in output,1
   actually i am not able to understand what the op wants,1
  i am glad to know that i am not the only one ,1
quoteif there is any visible elements and then hidequote visible could be some different thinks do you mean displaynone  visiblehidden other ,1
when a user clicks on a topic to the right there is going to be a description of what the user clicks on  i honestly dont know which i mean,1
typically the op already knows what he wants to achieve has made an attempt at coding it and comes here when he gets stuck  how are we supposed to help when you dont even know what you want,1
i know what i want i have worked on it tried jquery and javascript both have failed it could of possibly been because of a reference issue on them  i need to hide all elements when one is clicked to become visible,1
simply hide all elements at first then show the one you want,1
dont work isnt much to go on regardless of how obvious the problem is if there is an error message then you should let us know what the message is and where and no it doesnt help to tell us its on line 42,1
countof what  what is it supposed to count ,1
like the occurrance of any char like a of a given string something like if str is string object then strcountofa,1
let aside some introductory programming exercises when would you need it,1
i am not saying that if java did not provide indexof method in string then we can not calulcate the index of the given char in a string and it is up to imagination on when we would need the countof method there are number of cases and requirements again i was interseted in discussion of is there any particular reason behind leaving it,1
is there any particular reason for including it other than its convenient for you,1
yes the first few things that comes to my mind is the performance optimization handling complex string matching patternsand standard jdk provided behaviour and yes these methods are primarily for convenience,1
if so where exactly textcode segment of your program have a lookup for linker maps,1
if it had no location you could not call it  the mechanics of compiling linking relocating and loading are architectureosspecific and too broad for so,1
are the number and the nonnumerical characters always seperated by a space or not,1
tried something,1
show us what you have tried you could for example use str  linesplit  it will give you 2 strings in an array the first is your number which you can extract with integerparseintstr0,1
im not sure what youre asking,1
so you are doing some kind of reverse engineering here,1
a html page may contain many javascripts the execution of each javascript block starts with script ends with script may change dom what im asking is how can i know which part of dom get changedupdated when a javascript block get executed,1
if a dom element is beinh changed by a block of code it should tell you in the code which element is being changed post some code and we will be able to point it out for you,1
its better if you write a brand new js engine from scratch any existing open source one wont help you since their purpose is totally different even if you handle that with headless browsers such as zombiecasperphantom eg you will need huge amounts of processing power for each website tip its easy to mimic spidermonkey so that you can provide a working dom implementation to the target script blocks here is good start point httpsgithubcomw3camayablobmasteramayaamayajavascriptc,1

can the people who down voted my answer please also provide a motivation to they did so that would be helpful,1
youre being downvoted because your answer is not appropriate for this site  the question was how to check the device version using code not a stepbystep on how to check the settings on the device  your answer would be more suitable for ask different,1
  but i mean if this is a programming question doesnt it make sense to at least say what programming language you are using,1
i think the op wants hist not pdf,1
  the the op is abit confused with nomenclature p good point though,1
  welcome to stack overflow in general give me the code questions are not welcomed here youll want to do some of your own research and experimentation first and then tell us what you have tried were here to give you direction but you should assume youll need to write the code yourself,1
thanks jasonmc92 for your advise,1
the op is using 3x note the question tags where tkinter is renamed to tkinter see eg httpsdocspythonorg3whatsnew30htmllibrarychanges you are presumably using 2x,1
the question relates to a url a user has entered not the address they are visiting,1
your code runs good and outputs 496 httpsideonecomt4dejm,1
how are you allocating the memory  im guessing that youre trying to write to an uninitialized pointer,1
"i am just doing that

     char str
 scanfs str
 str  2
 printfcstr

if i type test i will get a v in the standard output",1
you need to put that information in your question,1
i do not think that the second example will compile,1
at least you will see the difference if you tried running the code first,1
in a quick guess the second example wont compile statements inside the first example would make it a property type whereas no getset in second example would expect it to be a function which is wrong by the syntax,1
what do you mean by wont let me run it,1
your code is damaged it matters where the  from buttonclick are caopypaste real code ,1
compiler says no errors  i find that a bit hard to believe,1
that said where do you think you are calling your method,1
are you aware there is a mathmax function in c,1
i think you need to follow a tutorial on c or something this is full of syntax errors,1
code is not correct method is out of class and look at the call of private method in calcbuttonclick,1
the value of altitude is being set in the someinformation method if the if block was not hit then the view would display an empty string not latitude2 as op has stated,1
my answer was submitted before the op fixed that section of the code before it was fixed the code was setting latitude and checking altitude now the code sets latitude checks latitude not altitude like you have in your comment,1
altitude or latitude makes no difference this has absolutely nothing to do with ops problem,1
i dont understand offset how are offset and temp related,1
somehow i feel that the included code was provided by the teacher,1
unicode the character set used by java has 1039 uppercase characters 27 of which do not have corresponding lowercase characters a key part of programming is avoiding incorrect assumptions,1
please make your question clear if you want the members to understand and answer,1
im just asking people with more experience how to write that if you dont know how to move along if you do please help,1
no need to be rude also you already asked a very similar but much better formulated questionhttpsstackoverflowcomquestions24147240typedefenuminswift a month ago and you did not accept any answer it doesnt encourage people to help you,1
what is the problem,1
is mark definitely a number not a string also you dont handle mark  8 or 11  mark  12,1
please state whats your input and what your expected output should be,1
one of the things that annoys me most about python is that it does duck typing but doesnt do it was completely as perl in perl if mark was 9 it would work as expected but in python calculategrade9 will work but calculategrade9 will not,1
"hi everytime i run the program i enter a number i just get no error but nothing prints out on the shell thanks edit write a calculategrade function that takes a mark as a parameter and returns
the corresponding grade as a singleletter string",1
  hm maybe call the function,1
is this your complete program how do you enter the number i have a feeling that you use python 2x and rawinput but no int,1
  python is dynamically but strongly typed implicit conversion doesnt happen,1
yes it is although i think ive been silly and it is working sorry for the inconvenience,1
  well the weak typinghttpenwikipediaorgwikistrongandweaktyping not the same as duck typing can ignore some errors errors should never pass silently  – import this,1
well the main difference is that using c classes is pretty hard given the fact that it does not have them,1
i suggest cutting your losses and deleting this  question,1
what sorting are you talking about,1
what do you mean by not able to print do you get some errorsexceptions or maybe unpredictable output btw you should start indenting your code this helps you see scope better and prevents a lot of simple mistakes,1
are you using some online compiler ,1
it dosent work too,1
never execute it it will makes another error like permission deny,1
why is there a p tag in the toggle when you have no p tags on your html also you have divs nested in your ul tag as siblings of the li thats is just wrong you can have your content elsewhere and show it with jquery it doesnt need to be nested in the menu,1
what does didnt work mean did you compile with all warnings and debug info g wall wextra g did you use the debugger gdb,1
youll have to be more clear on what didnt work means it didnt compile,1
"didnt work and i couldnt work out why
what errors you got",1
please edit your question to improve it,1
youre returning a copy of the screenarray from getscreen which looks dodgy to me and ive no idea what return false might do in that context but without knowing the details of how it doesnt work its impossibly to guess what might be wrong,1
which part if this code is not clear,1
where have you found this code since it was not documented,1
youre doing a lot of float to int conversions those are subject to some rounding errors id try to do everything as int if possible,1
you are using terminology which i suspect is shared only by other users of some unnamed package or discipline perhaps you should either present a complete example and explain your understanding of the term circle or consider finding a mailing list for users of this package or who share your understanding of these terms,1

what about ls ,1
no its impossible computers are not that advanced yethttpwwwbashorg5804 seriously though i think that this question needs to be less theoreticalhttpstackoverflowcomhelpasking before anyone will answer it for example what have you tried so farhttpwhathaveyoutriedcom,1
yes it is possible,1
det initially is 0 then del  whatever will give you 0,1
you start with 0 0 multiplied by anything is always 0 what did you expect,1
and it should be 15945 ,1
det  matrixij  matrixij sums the squares of matrixij so that result would be 1  1  5  5  9  9,1
the second loop is a bit pointless you could just say int j  i youre now doing pointless work to to find a value of j such that ij instead of just making it so,1
you should at least post an example what youve tried doing so far,1
please reformat your code it is hard to read atm,1

so you want to delete all lines starting with  function startproxy block and function stopproxy block regardless of where its found in the file and nothing else,1
  no  i just need to delete the six line beginning with  above the function startproxy,1
so how to know what  to delete  the 6 first it find how do we know where in the file they are since you have other text above it,1
so we need to search for  proxy server for iterm  terminal setup script then delete it line above and 4 below it  we should not delete all blank lines only those between function start function stop,1
  the answer you got will produce the output you expect from that specific input file that does not mean its a solution to your problem if i were you i would not use that on a clients files given what youve told us so far about their content you simply havent told us enough about your problem for us to hep you solve your problem in a robust way,1

quality of the question and title is poor can you explain what do you want to accomplish,1
please post the whole code and ask the question in an understandable waywhy are you looking for another solution whats wrong with the one you posted why,1
why not just create a class that holds the number and the text that goes together,1
and you require 31 minutes to mention this d  ,1
  yes it happens perhaps because im not paid for giving immediate answers and i also do other suff in the meantime ,1
it is unclear what your first question is and your second and third questions are quite broad,1
this is completely trivial to test you then need to understand that its an object you synchronized on not a field or variable,1
it will run synchronously so it will wait for it to execute,1

  in that case i probably misread your comment sorry for confusion removed my comment,1
why am i getting so many down vote on my question can people give constructive feedback i tried to make revision on my question i am just starting to learn java so is it getting down vote because people think my question is too trivial,1
  why am i getting so many down vote on my question probably because your question is wrong when i have void the code will compile  method cant compile with void return type if it contains return something inside it,1
why are you using 34 tab spaces for indentation  single tab also works for most of people i guess  and code looks cleaner as well,1
im trying to call savefile function  so what prevents you from doing so instead of mentioning the functions name scnr,1
the way to learn is by doing try something post the code and ask for help,1
did you already try to do this,1
if youre just starting out asking people for code like this on stack overflow is not the place you need to be you should find a good book or a series of online tutorials have a look at good resources for learning objchttpstackoverflowcomq1374660 the big nerd ranch books are excellent and lots of people like the stanford ios course on itunes u good luck,1
its alphabetical order,1
as stated in getkeystate msdn referencehttpmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms646301vvs85aspx the return value is a short 16 bits not a 32 bit value in other words 0x80000000 is not valid,1
i suggest you learn by trying it  learning from a book is one thing but you will remember it better if you try it,1
yes you can make object without generic classes the main difference is you are limiting the adding and searching of the data to the specified type rather than all kind of data the usage of generics is the proper way of implementing collections as they will only create objects which are specific to the requirements,1

since you havent told us to which language youre referring we have no way of knowing but in some languages its a boolean and operator,1
the output is undefined behavior,1
  in c evaluation of parameters is from right to left here,1
  the evaluation is undefined not unspecified which is even worse  there are some subtle differences,1
 silva  no evaluation of parameters is undefined here see c99 standard 65p2 and 6522p10,1
 silva  c does not specify the evaluation of parameters being rtol   in many implementations it is rtol because that makes it easier to manage the stack   but this is not required nor guaranteed,1
its to loop through the array one element at a time an array is a datastructure of indexes with values in it from some datatype in this example its objects  the objects can only be accessed by evaluating the elements in the index of the array the loop is the structure that achieves this,1
your while condition logic is incorrect  change all  to ,1
think carefully of what the condition would evaluate to if action is say 2,1
i believe its if or if else but a friend of mine says its if and if else but he isnt sure either so its a doubt between those two i couldnt find anything on google everywhere it just says nested if else,1
why dont you try writing actual c code to implement it,1

is it if or if else or if and if else",1

im afraid this question is not much if any clearer than your other question  and just adding a tag isnt going to help  are you trying to ask how do i do x in python  or can i do x in python  or am i trying to do x in the correct way  even if you can rewrite your question so that it is clear what you are asking it still most likely will be too broad or not within the scope of this site  check out the asking section of the helphttpstackoverflowcomhelp for this site,1
i still dont known why so many down votes there i have a problem and didnt find the answersolution over the internet so that i post the question here to hope that someone can help me resolve the issue,1
you should post the error line plus youre missing a trailing bracket,1
count  count is completely superfluous,1
also try to avoid using the variable name count or max or any other python functions methods or keywords,1
"indentationerror unindent does not match any outer indentation level on line 5
    if butterfly 1",1
if you use an appropriate editor or ide they will help you with spotting such errors  happens all the time  note also that the error is actually in the line above because the interpreter thinks your count statement belongs to the previous function call,1
why do you think it should be 0123,1
tim only removes whitespaces at beginning end end of a string not in the middle,1
  you dont have to remember what every function do however you have to read the javadoc of the functions you are using to understand what they are doing the people at oracle are doing a good job of documenting the core language methods please make sure you make good use of that,1
whats your question,1

datediff works with time values as well,1
what is the data type of your time data and show some examples,1
that is not the clojure way  if you are working with an object with an identity you should use either a ref or an atom an not a var  updating a var in the way you indicate should typically be done only in the case of a repl,1

post the code you have tried,1
is there a question,1
thats not the question the op is asking why you need a constant in that context,1
the question deals with inner classes and their behavior not the final keyword itself,1
because of anonymous inner class this has to be a constant,1

try to rename your file into foodat and see if the execution time is any faster by naming it that way my suspicion is the answer is no but i could be wrong,1
yes the first parameter must be within a range of 19 but the second parameter my be any number so far i create a string by looping the length of the length and then parse a int from the string but there must be a better solution right,1
the second number cannot be any number because you are returning an integer look into biginteger,1
this is dangerous because you can easily exceed the upper bound of the int type,1
specially the if statement i am not sure what the condition is,1
compile and run the code add lots of logging until you do understand it do you know yet which half of the if executes,1
i think the else part,1
why do you have an assignment and comparison in one line ie ifz x  y,1
you could use a loop perhaps,1

ok so whats your question this isnt a codewriting service,1
thats nice good luck figuring it out did you have a question,1
could you add a little more description about the problem you have,1
using the uri will not work,1
yes you can have you tried reading the documentation,1

well it did not work in some cases and i thought there might be other ways and methods of doing it like stop finish etc why did not you just reply like   did,1
well now its valid and   still has the best answer with some useful notes you have provided 0 of help just so you know,1
i never asked fixing it and you should read the question carefully instead of trolling what i did ask was if it would work in any case and   clearly explained when it would work and when not i am sorry if you do not understand english or have issues with helping others good luck to you ,1
this discussion obviously has no end it´s your right to help or not but as you see someone bothered to help and you spent more time arguing with me in chat then actually do something useful at this thread i got your point hope you got mine,1

i believe thats because you never initialize the array properly,1
in order that we can help you effectively you should give us as little code possible see httpsscceorg and describe your problem as much as possible ie give all error messages not just it doesnt run also to ask questions like heres my code find a bug for me is not very good,1
if any error occurs then then what getinstance will throw an exception what exactly is the behavior you expect,1
afaik the best way to implement a singleton in java is through an enum see this answerhttpstackoverflowcoma713991825094,1
if you consider enum hacky the spring frameworkhttpprojectsspringiospringframework has set up singletons for years,1
is it me or are you checking one condition two times in a row without doing anything,1
2 things 1 your instance does not need to be volatile 2 you can synchronize the getinstance method and lose the synchronized block within only check for null once,1
  making the method synchronized would potentially create a fairly large performance hit if many calls are made to getinstance simultaneously  declaring the instance as volatile is also importance and javas memory model does not handle doublechecked locking well httpsenwikipediaorgwikidoublecheckedlockingusageinjava,1
i am aware that enclosing too much in synchronized blocks is a performance hit but i stand by my comment because by far the most expensive operation in getinstance is creating the instance which would need to be synchronized anyway checking the existance if relative cheap and also needs to be in the same synchronised block so you may as well just synchronize the method volatile is unnecessary because uniqueinstance is only ever accessed from the same synchronized block,1
but note that this is almost certainly a bad idea youre going to totally mess up various overloaded function calls prefer to define operator for stdostream and myinteger,1
 lightness races in orbit i do not think so because as i have understood this class emulates integral numbers so it also can be used in arithmetic operations moreover i gave direct answer to the question there is no question what is better,1
it may emulate integral numbers but it is not one it is a class type implicit conversions — particularly to builtin types — are evil sometimes a direct answer is harmful of course in this case its hard to tell what the real use case is since this particularly example is so contrived and does nothing but wrap int,1
  races in orbit you are trying to discuss totally another question,1
you can talk the question asks for an operator and you give him a conversion operator were both looking for his actual problem and trying to give an actual solution,1
  races in orbit i gave an actual solution i did not answer the question what approach is better because i even do not know how the class is defined it is not my task to design the class your reasoning is simply stupid because for example its class can be a functor used for example in stdforeach algorithm and the best and simple way to get value is to use the conversion operator please stop trolling,1
you could refactor the object instantiation and start invocation into a new method on a static helper class and the stop and trace calls as well but really is this so offensive imho this is hardly verbose,1
fwiw you could use var sw  stopwatchstartnew and save a line,1
i agree with   it wouldnt be hard to implement this yourself but given the complexities of multithreading which js doesnt have the c way of doing things looks a lot better,1
  from the answerscomments it looks like i can reduce the lines of code quite a bit i think what im mostly opposed to is the duplication of output formatting logic im seen a lot of inconsistency and sometimes downright incorrect code in apps ive worked on so id really like to just do in right once a static helper method sounds like the right path to take here,1
this is impossible with all your arbitrary conditions like no width specified on items it may be helpful to provide the code you have already tried and why you want these conditions instead of giving us some specification and saying write my code for me,1
almost certainly not going to be possible without js,1
i just edit my first post thank you if you can help me ,1

im giving you a 1 because this sort of thing can be confusing as heck at times so you shouldnt be penalized forit  the way you need to approach this is to ask yourself why is it saying array subscript when its just method parameters and then look for some reason why the compiler thinks theres an array subscript operation going on  after staring blankly at it for about 5 minutes you slap your head and say of course  always look for the clues in the message  something that is out of place or inconsistent with what you think it should be,1
sorry im new to ios programming and have been working on this for a very long time very tired now but thank you so much for the help its great to now that no matter what my basic skills are there are always people who genuinely love helping,1
  heres a suggestion from a long time developer  take a break once in a while if you get stuck on something for a while leave it for a bit take a nap eat a snack go for a walk whatever give the brain a change of scenery then come back to the problem youll be surprised how such a break can help and dont forget some basic c and objectivec tutorials enjoy,1

what do you expect it to do what part of it is not working also you need to have a more specific title then this,1
what is soccode,1
i expected it to return a year and data value into the table if you take the url in the function and add a certain 4 fuigure valuethe soccode to the end it will give the data online this should then be returned to the table body,1
  one of the first things that i would check is whether the result of your get call is actually executing  for example you could put an alert in the body of your anonymous function  the function might not be executing for instance if your actual http request is malformed or incorrectly processed on the server  if the function does execute then the problem is likely with how you append values to your table  if it does not then you might want to use jquerys ajax call instead with an error function so that you can at least see why it fails  either way post back the results,1
  all it says when i run the function is uncaught typeerror cannot read property length of undefined so it is executing just not returning any results also where should i put an alert and what should i put,1
i would comment out the body of the function that you pass to get and put the alert there  eg alertgot here  even better maybe you could print the contents of the data object you get back  eg alertdata  the error that your describing might arise from assuming that data has a particular form that it does not  as a side note all the previous commenters that asked about what wasnt working would have loved to know about that error message  its a great example of something that should have been in your original post  you live you learn,1

  in general we try not to recommend that people use pasteboards here js fiddle or codepads are fine in order to make it easy to run the code but otherwise we want questions to be selfcontained this means that if pastebin drops off the internet or the paste is deleted the question will not become useless,1
  see above about recommending pasteboards here  we prefer people to paste the code into the question in general if the amount of code is excessive it is likely that the op needs to narrow the problem down further anyway,1

sql injection i can skip this using magicquotes and if magic quotes is not on i add addslashes youre not really starting on the right foot and forget md5 use a stronger method,1
every single line of your question is wrong  you need to learn a lot more before you can write secure code,1
look at pdo or mysqli to learn prepared statements for some better security and md5 for passwords ouch,1
caution the iframe hijacking httpseclabstanfordeduwebsecframes even facebook got that kind of attack,1
as slaks said every single one of your assumptions is wrong  its as if you took best practice security and did the opposite of everything  you need to take each point casebycase and understand what is going on if you expect to make something remotely secure  do some hacks yourself against your own code and see how easy it is,1
  i saw that but my question was really more general i am not asking just about sql injection but to prevent attack,1
most hash passwords algorithms dont protect you from rainbow tables httpenwikipediaorgwikirainbowtable,1
usually tls is considered the preferred method of protecting data between client and server  if youre not doing https for passwords youre in a world of hurt  sha1 or in the past md5 could be used to store a salted hash in the db for later  i guess you could do the hash on the client but that probably isnt typical for one thing client likely wont know salt    thats what salt is for,1
au contraire   thats what rainbow tables are for defeat salted hash the problem with hash they are very fast to calculate since they are intended to hash entire files and ended used to hash small strings the only way to avoid rt now is using a slow hash,1
youve got so much misinformation in this question that its worrying to an extreme a guide like php the right wayhttpwwwphptherightwaycom outlines the recommended best practices and is an essential read the information youre basing your opinions on is at least fifteen years out of date,1
  how are you going to precompute all possible hash results for a 2048bit salt field  where are you going to store them  note im talking about unique hopefully securerandom peruser salt  along with a server unique  even if you only tabled 123456 and password it wouldnt work,1
decode md5 good luck with that,1
  i am asking this becase i still find a lot of tutorial that use that information and since the argument is wide i post  here to have a grasp of what take for true or not and to have a list of problem  to analyze,1
  in a cloud of course and lets guess the storage capacity of those things in the next years but no fear theres already very slow hash algorithms just cannot remember its name now,1
  its great youre asking questions but the sorts of questions youre asking suggest youre using really awful references instead of trying to build an application from an empty directory the best way to do this now is to pick a development frameworkhttpcodegeekzcombestphpframeworksfordevelopers that suits your style and needs that will provide a lot of tested highquality examples to work from and you can leverage a huge amount of community code,1
  but one would need to build the rainbow table for each salt individually that’s the exact purpose of salts,1
  perhaps im just quibbling about terms  if you generate an entire unique rainbowtable for each user in the database after you get your hands on the password file id hardly call that precomputing,1
thats just more one dimension on the rainbow a table can get n dimensions use one for user other for possible passwords another for salts and go on,1
  i dunno your own article in wikipedia says this defense against rainbow tables a rainbow table is ineffective against oneway hashes that include salts  adding a fulldimension with 2048 bits 1 with 600 0s vs storage of the whole cloud 1 with 25 0s  math wins  unless i totally misunderstand the concept  which isnt to say bruteforcing my two users to find which is password and which is 123456 wouldnt work  only 2 salts in table though so i guess i should add some falsepositives,1
  yeah i readt that that article is good to explain basics rainbow table approach but i guess is outdated about using salt against it salt can help for sure but the only way i see in the long run to avoid rainbow tables are very slow hash algorithms anyway no one on usa can use good cryptography the government prohibits it ,1
  i can still get to openbsdorg  although i know our nsa keeps claiming to have cracked it all when it comes to secure data exchange  perhaps they moved from prohibiting to merely discouraging  which actually seems to have been far more effective,1
maybe spend some time researching some bash programming also you can type the same or equivalent commands into a terminal and just see what they do yes,1
x is an obsolete cumbersome and errorprone way to say x,1
 m neither obsolete nor depending on your keyboard layout especially cumbersome but yes errorprone and not all that easily readable  is definitely recommended,1
  posixsusv4 states that  the backquoted syntax has historical restrictions on the contents of the embedded command while the newer  form can process any kind of valid embedded script the backquoted form cannot handle some valid scripts that include backquotes  is specified by posix so id consider backticks de facto obsolete unless you have to deal with vintage shells bash definitely not being one of them,1
  you are right on some matters but not on all  for instance the cat command question q3 was tricky because cat is a command for concatenation but in this case it is being used to output the contents of the file as thankfully explained by someone else  i knew that cat was for concatentation because i did some research but still couldnt conclude with an answer  i am sorry i frustrated your experiencedsuperdeveloperhavingpermissiontopatronizeeveryone feelings,1
  i updated my answer,1
  well i do have strong opinions sometimes,1
  id recommend pumping the brakes a little ever consider looking at the man page for cat it has an explicit example instead of assuming im being a douche then being one yourself how about just reading some basic unix docs and trying some stuff out its the most efficient and effective way to learn its too bad youre so comfortable assuming the worst good luck,1
this is a wall of text and you scream at the end this is not the way to format a question,1
just in case you didnt know most internet users will probably consider exhaustive uppercase usage shouting youd likely receive more serious answers if youd change that since most people dont really enjoy being shouted at,1
you may be writing os agnostic code but the libs used by the compiler arent ex printf calls an os specific function to write to the console,1
  different implementations arent really a binary portability problem in the case of printf it forms an interface to shield off these details if there is binary compatibility at the interface level the underlying implementation would not matter,1
  well printf internally calls fprintf function and it is a part of stdioh library which is definitely platform agnosticand fprintdf too is a standard builtin routine common to c platform even if gcc itself has some of its own libraries to link during the build im using it as standard compiler and runtime on all the other machines running other oses so whats the issue does fprintf further do a platform specific system call os x in my case which cannot be resolved on other oses coz on those systems the runtime would go looking for them and not find them im confused,1
  sorry man i had the caps lock on by mistake while typing i should have been carefulwont happen again,1
  you should also lay off the bold youre overusing it badly when in doubt dont bold your text most posts dont need to contain any bolded words,1
with the formatting changes its actually an interesting question and there are three good answers here,1
sscceorg please,1
ok i made a mistake with mi last comment edited it sorry,1
hi and welcome it appears as if you have received a school assignment or work task and are asking us to solve a entire problem for you or simply find a library al tho we love a good challenge and try to help out in the best ways possible some questions require you to show some sort of effort in solving this yourself first it would there for be helpful if you could post a snippet of code or proof of research in what solutions youve tried and what workeddidnt work and post a stacktrace output or just a description of what went wrong is sometimes enough can you show us what goes wrong,1
  that has nothing to do with black hat attack is a feature in his text adventure game,1
  you are right my bad,1
when the user inputs their attack type it restarts the chooseatk function meaning the out put looks like this,1
"in which direction do you continue north1 south2 east3 or west4 
1
you are walking briskly through the forest when you hear a creature cry out 

you increase your speed and hope he dosent find you

you see a clearing coming up and decide to turn into it


 you come face to face with a creature you cannot identify 

 you must fight 

 will you use your strength1 or your wisdom2 to vanquish this foe

 you come face to face with a creature you cannot identify

def checkatkchooseatk naming a variable chooseatk inside a function will override def chooseatk for the record,1
wow did you really copy the exact same output that is in your code which we can already see and understand by posting a quote that long youre just making things more confusing because theres no formatting involved in the comment section p,1
im srry im new to so,1
another problem i found is that i need a header basically the string that shows the players health mana and money dosent update after an encounter,1
problem almost solved,1
care to clean up your code a bit proper indentation would be nice too also break it up between the functions if possible so theres no scrolling,1
i added some things,1
proper indentation is what deduplicator suggested,1
additionally what exactly did you do when you debugged and analysed this problem what were the results of those efforts,1
your code is difficult to read so it is not entirely clear to me what is wrong however one comment i will make is that rightleft2 is not really relevant in quicksort the index of the pivot variable even after partitioning is not necessarily in the middle take a look at the pseudo code in the wikipedia article on quick sort,1
the result of debug is that at first invoke there is no problem but after recalling it everything collapses i want to make recursive but,1
i dont do exacty quick sort i changed a little if smaller than n2 or bigger than it it will continune to invoke,1
what you say about lists simply isnt true,1
  please refer to the changes i have made in the question description and kindly tell why what i said isnt true,1
because in that code youre not doing the same thing at all youre mutating an element of the list not changing what the name refers to,1
but that is exactly what i had originally intended to ask when xy and y is a listif 2 copies of the list exist in x and y a change in x shouldnt make a change in y which it does why is the same not applicable to normal noniterable variables ,1
  thanks a lot the mutable presto chango rule cleared my doubt,1
how urgent,1
  client is waiting on the company floor ,1
could you please describe what error youre getting,1
error in line 13  at rtwminputinputjava13 and error in line 37 is rtwminputmaininputjava37,1
what is the error,1
error in line 13 is at rtwminputinputjava13 and error in line 37 is rtwminputmaininputjava37,1
  yes we can see where the error is since youve stated that in your post already but what error are you getting with the information youve given us so far i can only assume its a filenotfoundexception,1
  asking you what are the errors not at which lines you are getting the errors,1
at rtwninputinitinputjava13,1
"if you get any exception in line no13 means may be ie is filenotfoundexception 
are you getting this one ",1
can you just copypaste the whole text of the error youre getting not just at rtwminput,1
are you using any ide,1
error is in the package rtwm please check or provide that code,1
have a look at the first line of the code provided by the op,1
ya package is included no doubt about it sir,1
when i am compiling it its working fine,1
look into stringformat also dont expect us to do the work for you show us some effort,1
c and java are different,1
your question is too broad ,1
replace 38 with getcountrycode  should you return the string not print it though and shouldnt you pass an integer to the function or are you just doing things one step at a time,1
if you are printing in the method why do you have a string return type obvious error,1
you really should try to look at this with a debugger it is hard to tell what might be the problem as your variable names are not very descriptive either,1
i count 9 as the most continuous land unless you count diagonals,1
may i suggest that you include the code that creates your 2d array  since you actually create an array of arrays rather than a static 2d array its important to show how you did that  it might contain a bug and it is needed for anyone to run your code,1
   i count 10 contiguous zeros 3 in the first row 5 in the second 2 in the third,1
derp was counting 1s,1
since input2 is of type char shouldnt condition be input2xy0,1
stackoverflow is not a service for debugging your buggy program heres some good advice on how to find your own bugs you are already simulating it on paper which is a great start now compare your paper algorithm to the actual behaviour of your real algorithm using a debugger where they differ is where youll find the bug httpericlippertcom20140305howtodebugsmallprograms,1
   it depends on whether the array was filled with 0 and 1 or with 0 and 1 based on the fact that a visited location gets set to 2 not 2 i think that op is using 0 and 1,1
whats the error,1
use stringequals for string comparison,1
yes i can and an error has appeared so whats the error,1
this part when i enter in the right answer it says it is wrong any ideas,1
  have you read the question i linked to,1
  he wrote the error i think he means bug right after mentioning it so instead of just writing unconstructive comments you could try and correct his post with an edit,1
i was expecting a stack trace when i saw error that was what i was referring to anyway its clear to me now the unconstructive comment was in a reaction to the blunt answer,1
this is a really confusing question  you say cut it on the last word and yet youre expecting the first word  then you say allowed symbols are 10 which doesnt seem to have anything to do with what you said before  finally you say you want to echo only these words  so what do you actually want to do,1
as   said you can make a substring what is the problem,1
explode pregmatch and pregmatchall are other good functions to look at,1
it cuts symbols but not words ,1
just split the string and add the parts together while the size is smaller than target also 1 for i have google too,1
  its 11,1
  ha ha youre right oops,1
sorry guys mad mood today,1
 is assign use  in the if conditions,1
whys these many minus for an op making just his second question showing effort,1
if there a method youve tried thats not giving you good results google isnt likely to come and share their code and anything else is guessing or just telling you how wed do it and what   linked above is excellent btw is that actually the answer,1
i think its really misleading of google to give an answer like this  exactly what proportion of a year 259 days 5 hours 54 minutes amounts to depends on which year it is and also whether daylight savings starts or ends during the 259 days  theres actually no way to calculate this correctly  even with the mighty joda,1
where is your code why havent you provided the full error traceback your question is not what the title and parts of the question itself implies,1
actually it is i want to check if random is in a list if so change random again,1
this is why code and traceback is a good idea particularly if your english isnt strong its unambiguous,1
ive added a semicolon now i get unexpected end and you dont learn if you dont meddle,1
well then go learn how to count curly braces … and from now on indent your code properly to avoid problems like this,1
have you tried anything at all,1
there isnt even a closing tag for input and it doesnt make sense to use innerhtml on the input tag you might use it on textarea but for input you use value,1
   i literally said there is no closing tag for input,1
 朕會功夫 i interpreted that comment differently as in there should have been one so thats what i was missing  sorry for my misunderstanding ill clean up the comment the other info in it is likely to be read by the op by now,1
if you are going to throw you need to catch somewhere,1
if you dont want an error to be thrown why are you catching the error then throwing another exception,1
maybe an exception is thrown and your program crashes because youre throwing an exception you catch it but the rethrow it either catch   the error farther up the chain and log itdisplay an error message but dont crash the program or do that here,1
  i catch and declare exception err but dont use it anywhere i dont want the user to know exactly what the error is so i throw a customexception,1
where are you stuck do you know how to put text into a textbox what part of the solution is confusing you,1
  okay so catch it and just show a generic error message and log the dirty secret elsewhere,1
  wondering how to do that i want to catch and log the error and just display an error message to the user using an already implemented error message textbox,1
  thats three things you mentioned right there which one are you having trouble with,1
  i apologize i likely didnt use the best terminology to research what i wanted to do i had this try catch set up days ago because i ran into the error once and didnt want the user to see the specifics of the error and saw using a customexception as a solution at the time,1
where is the question ,1
first of all you should give your variables meaningfull names instead of just random letters second of all ident properly,1
why did you skip 101 102 or 104,1
welcome to stackoverflow please take a moment to help us help you what part of your program doesnt work does give an error if so what is it if not what output do you see and how does it differ from what you want,1
i think my program should work but it does not  so what have you done to debug your program  which line or lines have you identified that are faulty,1
if you step through the code in your head it should be obvious,1
i started from 105 because when you combine its digits and divide by 2 you get 3 and it is more than the first t which is 2 and the meaningful names is the least of my problems the debugger finds no problems,1
meaningfull names is just a lot easier for other people from whom you ask to debug your code are you allowed to create a function which checks if a number is prime if yes then i suggest that you check that function then feed all the stuff that you want into that function,1
even if this did work it seems to be in violation of your requirements it seems like you cannot use both for and if that seems like a silly requirement but if that really is your requirement you should make sure your code adheres to it,1
excuse me youre the one who included that requirement in the question,1
according to the requirement you can only use one for  you have violated the requirements,1
  oh i guess thats another legitimate interpretation i read it as you can use as many fors as you like but if you have any you cannot have ifwhiledowhile indeed you can have one for one if one while and one dowhile is also a valid interpretation,1
ip address check or they must login,1
i dont think any hacker will attack my website wrong on so many levels,1
delete line 5 thats were the error is ok seriously are you looking for programming experts or fortune tellers how would we know without looking at the code,1
your not mfc class assumption is incorrect cptrlist is derived from cobject that makes it an mfc class the answer from mrc64 has good advice,1
i have attached the code for the header file everyone please have a look,1
here they are 1 be more specific 2 be more specific 3 be more specific 4 be more specific 5 be more specific 6 be more specific 7 be more specific 8 be more specific 9 be more specific 10 be more specific,1
remember that java is casesensitive,1
seriously we cant read your mind and see the compiler errors youre seeing and playing a guessing game isnt something that a lot of people want to do also read those compiler errors carefully if you arent working with generics they should be quite clear,1
the compiler isnt lying to you  you have to be consistent with your variable name throughout its scope or youll run into situations like this,1
these are the errors,1
stop dont put them in the comments update your question,1
and make them readable for heavens sake no one wants to read a blob of text use the preview window,1
  dont write the entire comment in uppercase it looks like if you were really angry,1
sorry here i fixed it,1
you would get the best hint by properly indenting your code please put some effort into your code and into your question read the help center,1
  delimanolis  please ccut me some slack i just joined this place and really dont know how to use everything yet just this once i promise ill clean up my act the next time around,1
what did you find when you asked your preferred search engine about bidirectional iterator which part of that would you like help with,1
or just use rbegin and rend,1
or §2426 of the standard which this margin is too small to contain,1
it seems like you answered your own question,1
if i understand correctly vector will support bidirectional iteator but in one of c book they discussed vector supports only randomaccess iterator,1
  c 2011 section 2427 random access iterators paragraph 1 a class or pointer type x satisfies the requirements of a random access iterator if in addition to satisfying the requirements for bidirectional iterators the following expressions are valid as shown in table 111 in other words random access iterators implement everything that bidirectional iterators implement,1
  so all sequential and associative containers will support bidirectional iterators is my statement is correct,1
  no for example a stdforwardlist only has a forward iterator all sequential containers will use atleast a forwarditerator associative containers will use bidirectionaliterators though,1
  except stdforwardlist remaining sequential containers supports bidirectional iterators am i correct,1
  yes i believe that is correct,1
i mean this site is meant to help,1
  this site favors questions which are usefull to others its very unlikly that someon who has a similiar problem will stumble across your question,1

no worries also to avoid downvotes here show research or prior work and avoid asking not to be downvoted in the question to trace code problems one approach is to comment out things blockbyblock until it works and then introduce things again until it breaks that will help identify the area of the problem,1
use documentgetelementbyid not documentelementbyid,1
why not use the jquery library as its intended ship,1

use length instead of length,1
yeahok dont go into the details as much i just want a way to count the noof characters of a string in a string array,1
  arrays dont have length as i recall so that is not the problem here although strings do,1
please understand it is not suppose to be looking at the syntax hereplease try to understand the problem,1
  by your description it is the syntax thats causing the problem somestringlength wont work because strings dont have the attribute see my answer below,1
why do you need to use reflection  this really appears to be an xy problemhttpmetastackexchangecoma66378,1
i am curious to know why you want to use reflectionreflection has got its own side effect,1
what have you tried  what problems are you having  what about what youre doing need to be dynamic that is preventing you from doing this without reflection,1
indeed  if you know youve got a liststring you dont need to use reflection if you dont know youve got a liststring what do you know,1
help point you in the right direction httpstackoverflowcomquestions1347936indentifyingacustomindexerusingreflectionincsharp,1
i am creating something greater but i need to learn how to do this before ,1
  how are you going to learn if youre just asking other people to do it for you  youll actually learn how to do this if you actually do it yourself,1
i dont know if it is a liststring but i want to know how to do it for string or int but not if the elements are class type,1
consolewritelinextostring,1
  that said experienced net developers are going to immediately see that reflection is not needed as the question is stated instead you should change the question to listt also you probably want to be more explicit about what you want to do with t if it is simply write to the console then my earlier comment consolewritelinextostring will work without reflection,1
post your logcat and some of code where you got crashed,1
check your spinner values may be it is null,1
is it the entire logcat of your error,1
please post some code ,1
provide the code that dynamically populates second spinner with values,1
you are getting a npeyou need to provide your spinner code,1
you still did not provide the code where you access your second spinner,1
adding the spinner code now,1
spinnerlist  where is it being inited and populated,1
spinnerlist is an arraylist which is populated by another method before it the spinner is working because the items inside spinnerlist show up in my spinner dont know why the error occurs when only i am using my android phone to test no errors in the emulator,1
if my spinner was the problem the class name and the method which populates my spinner would show up in my logcat this is something else i reckon,1
nothing in your stack trace mentions any code from your program so you have either failed to include the entire stack trace or the failure is not actually in your code at all  you mentioned a custom rom and that could be buggy,1
its impossible with regex,1
please suggest the alternative way thenhave not tried yet just need suggestions to start with,1
your guess is wrong use a date parsing module,1
  can you please elaborate your answer it will be really helpful,1
  have not tried anything yet hence posted this for getting some suggestions to start with i have never asked anyone for any readymade code i will do it my own wayonly need some suggestions to start with and thats it ,1
  please explain why not possible,1
if the format of the dates is unknown this is going to be impossible what do you intend to do with 121212 getting dates in a typical format with regex and parsing them and formatting them with date formatters is possible,1
how come a regex alone detects the corresponding day,1
  thanks a lot for your explanation can you please suggest what should be the optimized approach for this,1
  i think the downvotes are for not showing your attempts and not completing your question to make it a question helpful to future readers,1
searching stackoverflow for java date format returns thousands of hits perhaps the reason for the downvotes anyways read the answers on the duplicate question i posted in above comment focus on jodatimehttpwwwjodaorgjodatime and javatimehttpdocsoraclecomjavase8docsapijavatimepackagesummaryhtml as the old javautildate  calendar classes are bad for you mental health little need for regex as those two excellent datetime libraries can do the heavy lifting for you,1
the regex would be used only to extract the dates from the text and to replace them with the formatted dates jodatime and javatime are not going to parse the dates out of an english sentence for you or do the replacement,1

myvector4 is out of bounds the valid range of indices is 0 3,1
but i am checking i  myvectorend,1
myvector isnt pointing to anything its a vector not a pointer i starts off pointing to the first element you then use each elements value to index the vector note that debugging this with a debugger would show you that i points to the 4 when the assertion is fired,1
  did you mean cout  i endl ,1
  so myvetorbegin should point to first element ie 1 not 2 but in my pgramm it is pointing to 2,1
  no and you can easily test it by printing myvectorbegin which will print 1 since indices are zerobased using that 1 to index the vector will of course give back 2,1
ya got the point cout  i should get the value not myvectori i done stupid question rightly downvoted my questions,1
  expected output should be 1 2 3 4 5  how can that be when your code only inserted 1 2 3 4 into the vector  where would the 5 come from,1
i cant believe no one commented on the void main,1
instead of apologise why not fix it and correct the indentation,1
did you try to debug and trace the code,1
"im doing a lot of things and i will fix my code once im done with it 

  i tried experimenting with the values but i do not know what they are at least most of them",1
   if you get into the habit of doing things right in the first place it becomes second nature,1
yes i know that and this project is an exception for it  i dont have time for arranging it now,1
because sumnumbers returns 0,1
you pass by value,1
return 0 might have something to do with it,1
you return 0 honestly what do you expect,1
not to mention you never initialise sum before calling sumnumbers this is undefined behaviour,1
  are you sure i mean the value of sum is undefined in the sense that it can be anything but im not sure this falls under ub which is tyically something like accessing objects after being deleted etc,1
  trying to use the value of an uninitialised variable is perhaps the most common example of ub the value of sum is accessed when attempting to copy it for the sumnumbers argument,1
passing a copy shouldnt matter because i set sum equal to the function,1
also the return 0 statement is never reached  that is certainly not why it is acting the way it is i took off the return 0 same thing is happening,1
  correct indeed this covers it httpstackoverflowcomquestions4279264isreadinganindeterminatevalueundefinedbehavior,1
  sum is assigned when the function returns the mere act of calling sumnumbers with an uninitialised variable is undefined behaviour but hey feel free to ignore helpful advice,1
btw you may write const int sum  stdaccumulatenumbersbegin numbersend 0,1
  how do i fix that i dont quite understand sorry if i am a little slow im just learning c new to it,1
  int sum  0 makes sure that sum is initialised,1
consider colorfromargbhttpmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrary2zys7833vvs110aspx  then specify the appropriatelyranged random value masking the alpha as desired but randomrandom colors arent always the prettiest,1
well if colors are based on numbers and random gives you a random number you could generate some random numbers and use them to construct colors if you run into problems after coding come ask a question read the documentation for random and color classes on msdn,1
just show how you would create a color from some ints the rest is easy,1
you are probably thinking of the problem backwards  an xml site map should likely be generated in a dynamic fashion on any site of sufficient complexity it sounds like you need to determine a strategy for representing your site structure in code and use this to dynamically generate both your xml and html site maps,1

  the code for the above pattern is not important for me i want to understand the logic to draw such patterns like how many for loops should i use what conditions should i use for space and printing ,1
typically the code will have two nested for loops the outer loop handles the rows  the inner loop handles the columns beyond that no one can say unless you precisely specify the rules that govern the pattern,1
  welcome to the stackoverflow the reason you are getting less response is because you havent shown your efforts for better and quick response always show your effort and your specific problem,1
  i am new to stack overflow  i am trying to code this from last night continuously i am failing to get that output therefore i had asked for logic to draw any pattern programs and for explanation i provided that example,1
you should include the code where the array is declared,1
you wrote that cards array has been declared in main method but you try to use it in draw method try declaring it as a class field or put this card array as param into the draw method,1
what is cc  you should provide more code,1
please post a more complete example is is very hard from the code snippet you provided to analyse your issue seems like you should past cards as arguments of your draw method  void drawcard cards,1
you might want to think about using arraysaslist instead of manually coping every card,1
the method name draw is confusing  is this supposed to draw a card from a deck of cards or draw a card on the screen  it actually affects what the code youve shown us probably ought to do,1
sorry cc is actually count,1
what do you mean by hidden and explicitly use it in most respects this works identically in c vs java,1
hidden in c as well,1
  in c when you create a class method you do not have to write thismvar  var  or something along those lines because it is implicit while in java you have to write thismvar  var,1
you dont have to explicitly use this in java unless youre trying to resolve name collision,1
you cant use this to chain constructors or access outer classes in c those are the only differences that occur to me aside from the dotarrow thing,1
"in stroustrups book it says
an ordinary member function declaration specifies three logically distinct things
1 the function can access the private part of the class declaration and 
2 the function is in the scope of the class and 
3 the function must be invoked on an object  has a this pointer
however in a textbook i am reading they give an example of a class  person  and they say that it is equivalent to the exact same thing plus this  and then they say 
in the latter case the this pointer is used explicitly and in the former case it is used implicitly",1
this is where i got my question is it also used implicitly in java,1
i assume that by hidden the texts mean a hidden parameter  not a visible parameter in the parameter list  and in that regard c java and objectivec are the same  this self for objectivec is hidden in the sense that its passed in the parameter list ahead of the first formal parameter,1
 łschielmann no because thats outside of a swing application  that example would violate swings threading policy,1

httpjsfiddlenetj0xc79bm1 missing braces,1
usually a line number is given as well want to share that crucial information or do we have to guess,1
obviously it should be something like var gosleepfunction   code here  ,1
a semicolon after function that doesnt look right,1
based on the code snippet there is a bracket not closing maybe the whilecount3,1
  no there is no missing bracket ,1
its not stdset or any other set data structure referenced here its part of a name of the functions to set the name i guess and sex of the person if you look further down in the class i can bet you will find those functions there do a search for the setter and getter pattern,1
it describes a method to change a variable for example if you wanted to put 2 extra wheels on your bike youd follow a method to achieve that you wouldnt just magically declare you now have a 4 wheel bike the new value is a result of some actions,1
thank you,1
this doesnt answer the question at all,1
youre right just answered it,1
but although the compiler will automatically set the c string size for you sounds quite wrong,1
"why dont you go and try it before you downvote and call me wrong

go ahead go make a  new charanyvalue

and make that char  anynumberoflettersyouwish
and watch the compiler go to work",1
try what exactly a memory leak oh a compiler error invalid conversion from const char to char,1
since when was a warning an error,1
"here let me try clarifying for you since you seem to be having trouble with brief explanations

    codechar text",1
why dont you post some real code in your answer to explain how you could use the compile time length of a string literal in a situation where you are trying to new a char array and fill it with the contents of an stdstring,1
"here let me try clarifying for you since you seem to be having trouble with brief explanations

char text  new char1 text  abcdefg stdcouttext

believe it or not that code will actually compile and display even though you set the text to char1",1
  the conversion from nonconst char to const char is deprecated and yields a compiler diagnostic and initializing text with the result of new and then assigning it something else can create a memory leak if this piece of code is executed repeatedly in your program,1
although the compiler will automatically set the c string size for you its good practice to specify the exact size so you get to see the mechanics of everything  this sentence is dangerously misleading or plain wrong what you perhaps meant to say is that the compiler automatically adds 0 to a string literal ie abc is actually a 4character array,1
  yeah thats how i shouldve wrote it  string literal was the word im looking for  im apparently not a c pro just yet  also im a pretty new cs student toying around with strings and cstrings  just having some fun   thanks for the clarificationsi had no idea i was literally assigning the char to an entirely different value without proper delete  i mistakenly thought i was setting the value of the new char1 to the string literal and the compiler was automatically resizing the array for me oops,1
  i long for the days of my youth when c strings were fun for me as well today they cause me nothing but trouble headaches time wasted i could have used for more interesting tasks and debugging sessions deep in legacy code written by people i have never known ,1
if you need to store two different types then use two different variable,1
do you mean if avg3  c instead of  if avg3  c,1
please take a look on the code how can i do it its need be something who can make average of maximum 3 numbers,1
  i tried it its not help,1
 means you are assigning it  means you are comparing it,1
ok but what i need to do,1
check my answer,1
"those are called property accessors you can read all about them here
httpsdevelopermozillaorgenusdocswebjavascriptreferenceoperatorspropertyaccessors",1
for eg datelist0name means access the name property of the object located in position 0 of the array,1
what you have is an array declared with  of objects each declared with  using datelistiname will not work with xml or json both of which are string formats that would need to be parsed first to create an object or array,1
thank you to bmceldowney paul tomblin and nnnnnn,1
and why not según sps00 in other words what makes madre ncfs00 and antigua aq0fs0 match,1
try a website like regex101com,1
for the moment i only want to return the tags aq0fs0 and ncfs00 with the word i would like wo know how to create a regular expression given those tags probably i will need to create more regex but this is just an example on how to aproach this task,1
why is antiguo not captured  does it have to be the first word in the line,1
you really need the results in reverse order like that because im pretty sure that will make things more complicated,1
to get you started try rwswsaq0fs0 and see what it matches figure out how to do the same thing with ncfs00 instead of aq0fs0 then look at the  alternation operator if you get stuck after trying that show what you were able to get working and where you got stuck and then youll have a good question put the code etc in the question but also provide a link to your test at some site like debuggex or regex101 if you have one,1
youre getting downvoted because of the inconsistencies in your explanation vs youre examples if you do a little factoring its as simple as bwsaq0fs0ncfs00b,1
  no it isnt antigua is separated from aq0fs0 by a whole other word that he doesnt want antiguo try your patternhttpswwwdebuggexcomr6iuu1ietitwu3xp also even after you fix the problems why add the b,1
   how did you get that from his examples and description one letter difference,1
  well he didnt answer mike christensens question but clearly your regex isnt going to provide the desired output and one that picks the first word is but again your regex doesnt even provide the second word because of at least one typo and i dont know why youve added the b on each end if youre trying to simplify things,1
  thay match since both are female words,1

joking aside seems like you might want to do some more research before asking this question in my opinion this is fairly basic knowledge string concatination and generating a random of some kind",1

what are you actually trying to achieve the variable name newnode is pretty confusing do you want to find an existing node and let the function create a new one if its not found also you dont need a class for this necessarily you could well create a free find function that operates on nodearray passed as a parameter,1
node nodearray  new node50 has a type mismatch,1
arrays cant have member functions so you cant do nodearrayfindname it would have to be findnodearray name,1

i go through stroustrups websites yesterday explanations in that websites are too difficult for me to understand if you can explain it more simply please do it,1
he is the creator of c why would you not want the answer straight from the horses mouth,1
i told already explanations in that website is to difficult for some one like me ,1
  i like his explanations eg sizeof cannot be overloaded because builtin operations such as incrementing a pointer into an array implicitly depends on it do you have specific questions,1
incrementing pointer to an array implicitly depends on it what does that means i have an array a10 if i do a2 how does it depends on size of operator,1
  how far the pointer starting at the first element of the array has to move depends on the size the elements inside the 2 means move the pointer 2sizeoft for type t,1
so when i do a2 compiler implicitly use the sizeof operator ist it,1
what error are you getting where do you thing the problem is,1
you failed to initialize total use int total  0,1
start with int total  0,1
youre missing an initialization of total to 0 since you just use total it contains any value which is quite random instead of int total write int total  0,1
compile with wall and you may see why,1
  actually using an uninitialized variable as an rvalue invokes undefined behavior the compiler may do anything if it sees that including but not limited to emitting a program that wipes all the storage in the computer,1
  i agree to your statement but the undefined behavior results from the memory of the variable not being initialized when the application is loaded total gets a place in memory this memory can contain any value depending on what the memory was previously used for therefore the value of total is undefined and may change each time you execute the application looking random for the application,1
  thats just one way how undefined behavior may manifest ub is ub and anything can happen it has nothing to do with the variable being placed somewhere if the compiler sees that a value is read from an uninitialized variable it may and will do really weird stuff random values poping up  are the least of your problems recommended read also c httpblogllvmorg201105whateverycprogrammershouldknowhtml – httpblogllvmorg201105whateverycprogrammershouldknow14html – httpblogllvmorg201105whateverycprogrammershouldknow21html,1

    string valq  19094
    string valc  19094  

i have the above code in the same class it is used for validating the entries",1
  well the only time you validate your entries is when you overwrite the old stock  my guess is that line the validation is always returning false and therefore you never actually add the new values just blank strings,1
  yes i think that you are right so i have to remove that validating line  but where shall i put it inorder to validate the input  sorry if i am doind stupid mistakes,1
  well the validation is at the right spot just the validation criteria is incorrect and is never passing  change your validation criteria to match the actual values you are passing in,1
  actually scratch that the validation should occur within the dowile loop  if it fails make them reenter it until it passes,1
  thanks alot for your help i really appreciate it,1
  i updated my answer to give an example of where you could put the validation,1
ok that helped me better i cannot thank you enoguh for your help i really appreciate this,1

unrelated it is very bad style to call srand in a function other than a function which is called once at program initialization unless you have an unusual requirement and know what you are doing srand should only be called once at program startup and it is a general principle that no library function should have the undocumented sideeffect of resetting the random number seed,1
  if you want something threadsafe this is wrong,1
  as rici points out even without thread safety issues this is wrong  with regards to thread safety the function rand is itself not threadsafe,1

you say that you want didselectrowatindex to run first and say that it already runs first i dont understand what you want to do here,1
sorryi meant after stupid me,1
why would you want prepareforsegue to run first it is called when you are transitioning view controllers so why would it be called before the current one is resolved,1
i changed my question to say after right now prepareforsegue is run before didselectrow i need a value from didselectrow to pass to another vc where prepareforsegue comes into play the way it is now the code passes a nil value to the next vc because didselectrow still hasnt gotten the required value,1
are you triggering this segue by your uitableviewcell being pressed,1
yupthats probably my problem right,1
but i dont know how to call an override function it just goes on its own,1
how can i get didselectrowatindex to run first you need to change your desires understand this its a framework the order in which it calls things is the order in which it calls things accept reality your job is to arrange your architecture so that that order is okay with you actually you should not be depending on any particular order because you never know things may change without notice unless they are explicitly documented to happen in a certain order and even that has proven to be no guarantee when it comes to apple,1
you could set up segue from view controller to destination in story board control drag from view controller to destination not from cell to destination give this segue an identifier then in your didselectrowatindexpath function call performseguewithidentifier after you set the shiftid,1

yes that is what you want to do and that is how it should look,1
i really really hope that there is absolutely no way that microsoft has built something like this into the net language  you may not think you are building a virus but the only difference between what you are describing and a virus is semantics,1
windows doesnt let programs hide themselves like that for obvious reasons if you could do this every virus would do this you would have write a rootkit to get this working,1
  pretty sure i have seen programs do this and by that i mean specifically virusesmalware,1
  indeed but they have to use a root kit  as i recall sony did something similar as a drm measure and got hit with a hefty class action lawsuit and that was in the 90s00s nowadays you would probably get arrested for domestic terrorism,1
  blizzard does this too with world of warcraft they have a separate executable that runs along side the program invisible except in the processes tab which detects if the player is using any other programs that may be contrived as bots,1
domestic terrorism is extreme hyperbole the most that would likely happen is your game gets classified as a virus the blizzard executable is nothing special it just never opens a window there is no way to legitimately hide a program from all of task manager some people have tried to coerce task manager into hiding their programs as you imagine this can get ugly and thanks to uipi might not even be possible anymore also your game concept sounds very familiarhttptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpvideogameimscared,1
  most likely because you did not show any research writing viruses is almost as old as cs itself so plenty of possible ways of hiding programscode for all sorts of os is already described everywhere you also did not propose any concrete way of implementing your feature and instead add whole lot of unrelated text to the post,1
this would be malware irrespective of you intentions it also would not be a game well you the malware author might have fun,1
please describe the problem you have what you expect your code to do and what it does instead,1
so is not a free coding service please make an attempt on your own if you cant get it working post what you tried and well help you fix it,1

yes i guess so but the thing is i know how to write a text file but i dont want to have to read the data when the program starts up,1
is that even possible,1
on which line do you get the error btw you should never just try and suppress errors,1
theres not 34 lines in the above please mark the lines with a comment,1
sorry its been corrected,1
there is no code in your question that tries to get a property of an object  also no have no constructor for your article class so check out what new articlerow really produces or what row contains,1
conn and sql should be conn and sql close this please,1
hiding the error messages does not magically make some wrong code works you have to make the code work not pretend it works and hide the errors as a developer the error messages are your friend they frankly tell you why the code doesnt do what you expect it to do,1
seems odd that it would tell you that there are errors on lines 3 4 and 5 it would usually hit one and throw an error not collect data from all errors and show them to you,1
its probably not a great idea to edit the meaning of a question after you originally ask it,1
its  you call it greater than or equal to not equal to or greater than hence first  then  the syntax for operators is described herehttpsdocspythonorg34referencelexicalanalysishtmloperators also the you cannot use two operators one after an other is and ,1
numerous things are wrong with this when you are programming everything has to be exact and spelled perfectly its rawinputpromptstr not rawinputpromptstr or rawinput its if x  y or if x is y not if x is  y etc,1
change the line if age is  21 to if age  21  there is no is and as bakuriu said the greater than sign comes before the equals  the internet is flooded with examples of proper if statements  what you need to do as youre learning programming is to look carefully and see that each character is right  twobit alchemist found a few more errors that python would have complained about after you get past this one,1
hint you dont really need a loop you could solve this with just a little bit of math,1
what do you mean 1s how many numbers contain a 1 digit 111 contains a one so it counts for 1 or literally how many 1 show up in all of the numbers eg 11 counts for 2,1
then just return 80000000 its the fastest way,1
smells like homework,1
agree with  swg a loop here is the most brutish of force especially considering the repeated use of ,1
 swg yeah that sounds right although im trying to figure it out nowgrrrrr must do real work,1
smells like homework and sounds like op missed a few days in class,1
this is literally just 100000000  8  10,1
  its also literally 40000000  2 but that doesnt help the op the important thing is how you arrived at that equation,1
  number of total digits in the range divided by 10 because the chances of it being a 1 are 110,1
  of course this only works for numbers which are powers of 10,1
  the correct formula for the number of ones that appear in the numbers less than 10n is n times 10n1 in your case n is 8  but i agree with the rest of the commenters the fastest way to compute that number is simply to return it,1
try use the float type 3f  5,1
when you say no matter what type i use do you mean youre changing the type of just difference or of ordinates startx and endx,1
35 is not float  that is integer arithmetic as are your variables,1
  in this case yes but in other cases it can be doubles,1
since when does 3  5  0 always youre doing integer division,1
35  0 sounds right to me now 3050 that sounds like 60,1
  how this is c thats c this has nothing to do with temperature conversion while they have some similarities this is a different question,1
  theyre fundamentally the same  those trivial differences do not make your question notaduplicate,1
too few commas after hwnd window,1
and whats this result  ,1
"the comma is actually there in my code thats weird 
i filled in result and i still get the c2447",1
  can you give us at least the complete error message please my compiler doesnt have any error like c2447 wth is it,1
wcommonbasecpp8  error c2447   missing function header oldstyle formal list,1
the reason is that you have a trailing  here lparam lparam try remove that and see if it works,1
"error c2143 syntax error  missing  before 
error c2143 syntax error  missing  before 
error c2065 wmclose  undeclared identifier
error c2051 case expression not constant
error c2143 syntax error  missing  before 
error c2143 syntax error  missing  before ",1
thats kind of messy but thats what i get when i remove that semi colon,1
   change wmclose to wmclose notice the case,1
suppose you have created a video software it can be used for downloading videos as well as viewing and converting at the same time to implement this in java threads are required,1
the question in the title is very different from the question in the body of the post please clarify,1
this question is well out of scope of this site as it is far too broad beyond that it asks one question title and then brings up a completely different question in the body,1
welcome to stackoverflow to ask about what x is needed for you should first get a basic understanding of what x is read about java threads and then come back with a more specific question if you will have one,1
generally speaking guis are single threaded that is all the ui code should run within a single thread blocking in anyway would have cause the ui to become unresponsive and ruin the user experience many ui toolkits have means by which you can stop the vide execution at a given point lookup modal dialogs which are safe for user within the ui thread,1
you need threads to separate the work of your program so if for example the user has to drop a folder into the program with 100000 files this is work for extra thread or threads so the main thread of the program not stack and the user during the background proccessing can do other things and not wait 10 minutes for example unable to do something cause of stack,1
strncpys  function does not take 3 arguments there is your answer right there the arguments you passed are char  char int thats three arguments and thats wrong see remyabels link which is actually the top hit when you enter strncpys in a search engine,1
if this is indeed c as it was originally tagged then why not use stdstring and friends,1
missing include   to be fair microsoft also documents a conly 3argument version,1
why cant you use strncpy not saying it would be any better than strncpys just a different kind of bad anyway firstarray is a 1element array of char so things are equally bad either way also avoid tcharhttpstackoverflowcoma3002494,1
firstarrayi is not a char pointer,1
  actually it seems to be but it probably shouldnt,1
  i think you mean texti is not a char pointer texti might be,1
this would much simpler by  using a sql database,1
since you wrote i know how to write the code please show what you have done so far and clearly point out the piece where you have a problem with and what you tried so far this will highly increase the chance you will get help,1
i am not asking anyone to do my homework for me that would be very stupid since i have to give an exam as well and then i wont have stackoverflowcom over there to help mei am asking for help on topics which my instructor has not yet taught but assigned the due date very early for this so i want to have a head start on it  for me to actually start writing the program i need to know how to import the data from the file and then make the program use that data that is what i am asking,1
please dont post answers into question selfanswer is ok also your use of reflection makes no sense when simple new restriction would allow the same behavior directly,1
selfanswer is not yet allowed restriction time could you elaborate on your comment please  im not sure to understand thanks ,1
jquery is regular javascript where is your consolelog in your code note that unless you defined variable count somewhere else it is undefined until you click metric or imperial,1
this question is impossible to answer in its current form we need more context try to put this together a jsfiddlehttpjsfiddlenet–or even better stack snippethttpblogstackoverflowcom201409introducingrunnablejavascriptcssandhtmlcodesnippets–that reproduces the described behavior,1
jquery is just a bunch of javascript functions written by other people you pass data between functions the same way as usual,1
jquery is a library of javascript they are not separate languages so of course they can use each others variables in fact they both use the same variable not different,1
your modification is not even syntactically correct could you please not try to improvise anymore,1
i fixed the snippet of code also i meant from jquery to vanilla javascipt,1
jquery is just a library it is vanilla js,1
you did not fix the snippet of code after your edit it throws uncaught syntaxerror unexpected token ,1
dfsq  i want to track the count from one stage to the other stage,1
"whats function test
   consolelogcount     
 supposed to do",1
not sure where to start,1
i want to see the variable be displayed once i click on the two buttons,1
  — then you have to do something to display it when you click a button,1
  currently getting undefined can you answer this question can you pass a variable from jquery into javascript,1
facepalm jquery is javascript its like a cheat sheet people make functions to make it easier for others to use so if you have a variable in jquery you can access it using your own functions without the use of any jquery,1
   you would have to get in your head that jquery is just a helper library to achieve things in javascript that otherwise are a lot harder to achieve,1
not a good way but i use to do whilefscanffpsstreof,1
using fscanffp str str will cause undefined behaviour  you are overwriting your string pointer with the input you just read,1
  that only works for s  if op is scanning other things then the matching against a positive number is better,1
  your post is very unclear please post the actual code you have tried so far make sure it compiles before posting,1
  oh ok thanks for telling,1
sorry for the poor qs actually i want to scan the int from file  store it into array but i dont know how to exist from loop,1
and what have you tried so far how did or didnt it work what are the actual results,1
try n  65537,1
  why 65537 unless im misunderstanding something should multiplying by 65536 correspond to a 16 bit left shift,1
  add one to preserve the value in the lower 16 bits as well as copying it to the upper 16 assuming the input value fits into those bits,1
  but hes asking for copy not move  on the other hand while my comment answer works for some inputs its a joke answer and the problem is underspecified and wait til the teacher tests with an input like 1234567 cause internet,1
what are we supposed to do with that,1
please try to include all relevant code here and maybe in jsfiddle so we can see what is happening  without context your css means very little,1
not to mention that 50 of that css is invalid  there are no spaces around the dashes in selectors such as but not limited to backgroundimage textalign marginleft etc    editing out his css mistakes might actually make the question invalid  the problem might have been his old css with spaces in the first place,1
i tried to post a screenshot but i dont have any score  i thought the classes spoke for themselves but i can post the html if that is what you need  i figured out how to make it work well enough im sure ill pick up on it eventually  for some reason html  css are harder than serious languages to me,1
yeah i see my question was very broad and you guys had nothing to go on really  it was like 5 am i should have just went to bed,1
got it wrong here doesnt give any indication of what is wrong please be more specific in future but look at the declaration of ch in main compared with the type that your uppercasetolowercase method requires,1
stringtouppercase httpsprocessingorgreferencestringtouppercasehtml,1
well for one thing you return the unmodified ch value instead of the newly created variable value first of all make the variable name lower case second of all return that variable instead of ch secondly make sure your types match,1
also you will like to return variable instead of ch in the uppercasetolowercase method,1
i dont see how it makes sense to add this without adding it to eg the end of an if chain as well and as eric keeps repeating the benefit from this over putting a try around it would not be enough to implement it over another feature,1
because ,1
  can you point me to what eric said,1
the using statement is not meant for catching exceptions its meant to be used to ensure that dispose is called even if you have an exception its the equivilent of doing a trycatchfinally and putting the dispose in the finally,1
  thats pretty much what i expected id hear ,1
using serves as an indicator that something is going to be cleaned up saves you from remembering to explicitly call dispose and gracefully handles exceptions thats a big benefit over writing it yourself every time,1
  its probably in half of his answers on here by now,1
i would then ask why they bothered to write the using statement in the first place  because most of the time you need a using statement you dont need a catch block,1
  i would argue that it does not always gracefully handle exceptions in fact it eats them in certain scenarios especially when used with wcf,1
  i actually knew what you meant but that doesnt address the question there are times you want control over the catch portion and you have to nest it inside a trycatch but wouldnt it be cleaner if you didnt have to nest it and could override the catch that using generates,1
  the emitted code from a using does not include a catch it is a finally,1
  really you dont expect and log exceptions when doing any kind of io operation,1
  thanks point is the same though instead of overriding its catch block pretend i said add a catch block,1
  when jonskeet codes io exceptions catch and log themselves out of respect,1
  i typically only catch the exception at a higher level and log the exception there i have far more using statements than catch blocks,1
i think the important takeaway here is that newbies might misunderstand how these two syntactic bits of sugar are different from each other  i dont think this is a completely useless question though the title should be changed so as not to mislead others,1
  why did you change the title i know how to do exception  handling inside a using block and thats clearly not what the question was about at all,1
  your title could be very misleading to newbies as using blocks are similar but distinct from exception handling,1
  so that means you need to change it to ask something that has absolutely nothing to do with what im actually asking thats misleading,1
  ask yourself is this question about how to do exception handling inside a using block no it is not its a question about why a language feature doesnt exist if youre going to change it change it to something that still reflects the actual question please,1
you should try searching on google before posting in so,1
whats the reason of the define it doesnt work and triggers a warning,1
isset also check the value for whether it is null or not,1
thank you all for your time and effort as i said i dont want to use any condition we just had some fun here,1
  char s this isnt a 2d array this is a pointer to a pointer,1
a total guess stdvectorstdstring,1
you never should you should use a vector of strings,1
what if i dont want to use vector is there any way that i could declare s in class tool thank you all,1
when you say you dont want to use a vector is there a particular reason you dont want to strings will be much easier to manage in a vector as compared to a array of pointers to string arrays so unless you have an incredibly good reason to not use a vector you should do that,1
because i use a api that developed by others one of the  api function parameter is char argif i use s1 it works well but i really dont know how i could define s in class tool ,1
please do not use line number in your code here,1
your question needs massive editing fix code formatting and also we dont know anything about your server or api,1
how are we supposed to read this code,1
guys is it readable now ,1
what is client server,1
simply i send a message from androidclient  to pcserver url  http19216813718080speecomdoublemeservlet,1
the program works the way it is now but in main if i change writethe number 0 is greater than 1n 5651 3427 to writethe number 0c is greater than 1cn 5651 3427 for example the program doesnt work,1
anyone im not sure what is wrong with my question,1
i actually did debug and came up with the same answer as the guy below me,1
so then why did you need to ask thats why you got downvotes,1
because i was having trouble figuring out the issue what is so difficult to understand im new at programming and needed help so i asked,1
yet as you just said you did debug and you found the answer yourself contradiction detected,1
yes i did after struggling for hours lol so i decided to ask after taking a break and coming back i was able to find it on my own no harm in asking for help especially when your new,1
what im trying to teach you is that you should take the break and come back and try again before resorting to asking for help  that you figured this out on your own is proof that you did not need to ask hopefully now given this success youll have the confidence to do that next time,1
are you running this on a server or your local machine theres also a big gap in your second link,1

  to be ontopic for code review the question must be posed by the author or maintainer of the code you cant just ask for code reviews of random code that you found,1
  it must be by the author artur have a look at thishttpcodereviewstackexchangecomhelpontopic near the bottom of the page is a little checklist  if you answer all the questions with a yes it should be on codereview one of the questions asks for it to be by the author,1
or maintainer whoops,1
or owner heh,1
im not sure if op is talking about windows,1
while it may not be common nowadays to have intmax be 2151 it certainly is possible maybe its not common on todays desktop computers but dont forget about embedded systems for example,1
and 32bit operating system refers to pointer sizes  address space size not necessarily int sizes,1
windows x8664 uses llp64 data model ie win64s sizeofint and sizeoflong are still 4 httpenwikipediaorgwiki64bitcomputing64bitdatamodels,1
the op isnt getting any error so doesnt make sense the 215 doesnt apply in this case,1
  so what this doe not mean that an int will have 32 or 64 bit with the usual 2complement and no padding etc an int could have 7byte with 13bit each too even on a 64bit system which only means that the address space is 264 byte big,1
my professor went off the book for this i took notes but really i cant find any explanation for this kinda thing was just looking for a basic rundown on this,1
you should use the preview feature to check your code is correctly inserted and readable the preview is wysiwyg so its reliable,1
for some specific input please provide the expected and actua output and please please format your code so its readable you have heard of indentation,1

also take the time to format readably,1

output is nekaj ne delas pravit is not taking input from scanf,1
  have you tried printfyou entered char cn op just by curiosity,1
  ill bet anything that scanf reads input but its not the input you expect it to be please edit the question to show the actual input,1
i think you all have read the problem and also punished me by down voting menow will you help me to find why this program is taking input istead of using scanf and why it is giving drect default value as a output,1
why are you reading r from stdin it is the result variable,1
we have not only told you what the most likely problem is and how to solve it we have also told you how to improve the question also see httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask and you havent done that neither have you acknowledged the solutions posted both as comments and as answers start by telling us the complete and actual input you enter to your program then modify your code to see what scanfhttpencppreferencecomwciofscanf returns and tell us that as well,1
it is not taking any input it is just giving nekaj ne delas prav as output and then program terminates,1
have you tried debugger,1
aha i found the problem i did use the wrong port thanks anyway for your comment,1
then you might consider to delete this question,1
no i still have another question regarding the class above i use this class via another class who is calling the getmail method but maybe i better can ask that question in another thread,1
users gave me minus points but not answer i am new in java why,1
this code doesnt find out if the final value is what double or int the final value is a float because the division involves two floats,1
sir you need to try this code if user input is 24 answer is 2 not 20 and if user enter 53 answer is 166667 not 1,1
it doesnt matter the type is still float if is to do with how 20 gets printed to the screen not its type,1
  have you tried using intfor a and b to me it is not very clear what your question is so i am just poking around if you want to do division without rest in java you would define the parameter as int,1
simple thing is if user input is 24 the answer is 2 not 20 and if user input is 53 the answer is 166667 not 1 according to my c code can anybody do this same think in java please,1
  i added an answer explaining where your understanding is wrong,1
now you changed the meaning of the question completely,1
sir i update my question again read it or second think you know in calculator if we type 42 the answer is 2 not 20 and if we type 53 the answer is 166667 not 1 i just want to create something program like that i think now you understand me,1
why cant you understand that it is just the way the number gets printed to the screen i already explained that twice once in my answer,1
making the constructor protected still allows you to specify what the constructor parameters look like,1
true but doing so requires the derived class to call super or risk missing init steps that might occur abstract clarifies this is the signature only no implementation  it would be best if interfaces allowed to specify the constructor signature but since they dont i consider abstract classes the next best thing,1
you can not avoid calling super it is called implicitly if you do not explicitly call it,1
the point is not to avoid calling super the point is to specify the constructor signature,1
just to clarify this idea doesnt even work abstract is not a legal modifier for a constructor you make a class abstract by modifying the class declaration theres no way in java to mandate constructor signatures for subclasses they are never inherited,1
i am fully aware that the java language specification does not allow for this i was making a point why it would be useful if it did,1
its dishonorable to copy someone elses genius solution parrot it as your own and not give them any credit,1
this is a complete disgrace,1
the socketio client code is obviously loaded or the op wouldnt even see polling xhr requests,1
when you include socketio in the server app socket io makes the client side library available at socketiosocketiojs,1
because it hashes instead hashing doesnt preserve ordering,1
because order of insertion has nothing to do with hashing,1
you answered your own question with an array the index is a number that increments with each insertion the index can therefore maintain insertion order as you almost said the index of a hash table is the hash of its key and so unrelated to insertion order and perfect for quick lookup,1
what do you mean which one is invoked  you can figure out which one gets invoked by looking at the arguments passed to the method when it was called,1
please put some effort into formatting your question,1
people please do not downvote without leaving a reason why you downvoted this question,1
thank you everyone for your responses sorry is everyone feels it is a bad question i did explain i am new to both java and android,1
you know the elements you have a for loop running and you know about accessing arrays using indexes what else is difficult here,1
php runs serverside javascript runs clientside youll want to run some javascript function upon clicking the trigger button,1
you dont need php for that php simply outputs htmljs a button to enable or disable that would be pure js,1
no it cannot be done with php yes you can do it with javascript but it will depend on what the some javascript code does,1
also technically it could be done with php you could send a get flag to not include js files which would in effect disable the javascript on the site a session variable could be used to remember this request for the user and then could be turned back on using another get parameter in the request,1
 420 but then each enablingdisabling action would require a reload of the page or at least parts of the page which is completely unnecessary,1

what the question is ,1
i could have guessed what the question was but is not better to ask before posting an answer just to be sure,1

its an application of 100k lines of code i am just asking for a general solution to be able to debug it by preventing the computer from freezing,1
do you guys have any technical solution for that kind of issue  yes  use your debugger i cant debug as it freezes the computer  a debugger doesnt start the program on its own  you have total control over when it starts where to place the breakpoints etc,1
you dont give us any details about what your program is doing what compiler what operating system,1
without details you wont get any meaningful answers and no one else  in the future  will benefit from your question either that is why it is downvoted and flagged as too borad,1

you didnt make a class,1
public and static along with self are keywords that can only work when writing a class you just have a function so either create a class or rewrite the code to a regular function,1

also a recommendation to try to improve the formatting of your code that you post in here and your code in general good formatting including using an indentation style that is uniform and consistent will help others us to better understand your code and more importantly it will help you to better understand your code and thus fix your own bugs also it shows that youre willing to put in extra effort to make it easier for the volunteers here to help you and that effort is much appreciated,1

  yes id like to know how ,1
  you beat me to post it,1
store the 4 values seed x y and the result of the generated random number inside a data structure then for future calls of your method search the value of seed x and y and return value,1
  ill take a look at that,1
  oh nevermind lol,1
well heres some legitimate reading for you httpenwikipediaorgwikipseudorandomnumbergenerator its a very complex subject but there are many algorithms out there for turning sequential inputs into difficulttopredict outputs but then theyre all built for singleseed multiread meaning they have a slow startup time as i said in a comment on an answer youd be better off defining simple seeds for entire chunks of your landscape and generating all the numbers for each chunk at once with coords in the same order then you get deterministic behaviour and fast processing,1
what is the whole purpose of the word random then if you want the same number for eternity why cant you use public static final float neverchanges  02f,1
  ok thanks for that i will read,1
  because that would not be useful to generate terrain that is flat ,1
three inputs guaranteed to return same output is not a random number generator or even pseudorandomness,1
  ok fine you win i was looking for a function with three inputs that returns a number that is different then all the others depending on the x y and seed values is that too much to ask,1
then ask that question,1
  this sort of thing is what pseudorandom generators are for repeatable results with randomlike distributions just consider all three inputs to be parts of the same seed the op should have posted asking about a pseudorandom generator rather than a random generator but i think thats splitting hairs besides not everybody knows about random vs pseudorandom,1
  thanks for the support on that,1
  i edited my question just for future reference what would the new method be considered would it be random or psuedorandom or something else,1
i would call it a method that returs a repeatable output i would so use decimal over float from three integer inputs that preserves a pseudorandom output with only one of the three inputs as static random input  i am not a statistician but i am a programmer and mathematician,1
this does not add any value to column 2  the additem method takes a value and optional index row index as argument,1
  since the rowsource type is value list delimited strings are interpreted same as columns above code from kong will work,1
  in which version of excel using 2010 debugprint listbox1rowsourcetype raises a member not found error i can see it in the locals window but not in the properties pane,1

marked your comment as helpful thanks,1
can you post your code attempts so far and clarify where youre getting stuck,1
startstop,1
just accumulate them into a sum whats so hard about that,1
your code does not appear to be c are you sure you tagged the question correctly also you are not receiving the number from the user nor are you accumulating only calculating the numbers between 1 and the given number,1
  i removed the c tag i am programming in c but this was just some rough pseudocode to help explain where my thinking currently was hence the mistakes,1
  daniel crocker no need to be rude and assume that i should automatically know how to accumulate,1
   if you are loking for a c solution dont remove the c tag  but you should have stated this pseudo code how can i do that in c,1
  that was my mistake readded the c tag,1
  you should modify your pseudo code to be actual c stackoverflow uses the actual language as the basis for communication as everyone here who can help knows c better than your own variant of pseudo code also having a minimal program helps better define where to go next,1
why jan15  is under month  shouldnt it be jan or january,1
when do you say that a given month is greater than mar15  put that logic in a method and call it to check,1
your data is way too inconsistent cant even parse the month as 3 letters because of april,1
see the duplicate topic i suggest split at fourth character and youll be done if youre data are ikconsistent april youll have to do it manually and we wont write it for you so show your tries,1

you guys could help him ask the question too   1,1
which type of file are u creating,1
you can type any file extention like txt exe,1
whats your question,1
sorry its not a questioni just uploaded thats all,1
  what do you mean its not a question it has to be a question thats the format of this site,1
then you can use only font size your buttons size connected whit your font size,1
i dont have anything to do with button size the question title is bootstrap 3 btngroup nonresponsive behavior on small screens try to build simple btngroup with 3 buttons and resize the window to a very small you will see what happens with the buttons but please after that do not suggest me to add whitespacenowrap to a css because i asked for advice how to win this wo bringing new styles only bt3,1
you can do something like this div classbtngroup btngrouplg btngroupsm btngroupxsdiv,1
have you actually tried what you said in your last comment thatll just make buttons have the btngroupxs style what they should implement is something like btngrouplgxs that makes buttons have lg size when the screen is xs,1
30 of what the rows 30 of 10 rows,1
meaning that i want to find the mean only for the first 30 of the data 2463  4  ,1
meanheaddata 3  nrowdata you said bottom but you meant the 30 lowest values not the last 30 rows,1
yes 30 of the lowest value in the data  ,1
"what if i have 2 columns for example i have 

x matrix 110 ncol  2

i tried to use meanheadx 2  nrowx but it gives me wrong answer 

it should be 125 for the first column and 672 for the second column

 ",1
applyx 2 functionx meanheadx 2 for the first two elements of each column,1
thats great tqqqqqqq  ,1
and last question what if i want it to calculate the mean for different elements in each column for example first it calculates the mean for the first 20 elements in the data then it calculates the mean for 30 elements in the data and so on where should i specify it first it should give 15 and 65 answer then it gives 2 and 7  ,1
something like lapply25 functionii applyx 2 functionx meanheadx ii however this method becomes a pain if you want to skip the first few head and tail are just kinda hacky quick ways to subset data,1
delete is not supposed to clear the memory contents,1
undefined behaviour anything can happen,1
by chance you are referring to the old memory before the os has happened to reclaim or reuse it it is not guaranteed to work and should be considered a bug in your code,1
you shouldnt be using new and delete anyway they almost always lead to bugs this is c not java so we dont need to explicitly use the heap just do int c100 instead of new then you dont need to delete,1
you could also use a stdvectorint c100,1
in modern clean c application code evolution completed by c14 and makeunique if you use any of new delete raw pointers or even in most cases c style arrays you are doing something wrong use c stl or other containers values with move semantics when practical and smart pointers like uniqueptr for heap allocations it might be better to learn these first and leave more primitive stuff for later maybe after learning the implementation of librarylike template classes,1
  i would even go so far and argue that learning to deal with new and delete is only useful if you have to maintain legacy code bases there is absolutely no need to learn about them otherwise not even late you would just be burning precious brain cycles for zero benefit,1
your array is uninitialized also yelling please help me wont make us want to help you more rather the opposite,1
teamlist57 0 is out of bounds,1
do you mean i have to put  int char teamlist57 above aswell or just put int in front of my array line of code,1
sorry for yelling lol,1
how do i fix it,1
no   means that arrays are indexed from 0 so the last index is 46,1
the last element is teamlist46 and arrays are not zeroinitialised look up arrays in your fine book,1
and then give them up and use the stdstring class and containers,1
if anyone can fix my code for me it would be greatly appreciated its for school ,1

"i wanna to insert prime number from 0 to 150 in linked list 

and calculate the sum and the average of this linked list elements ",1
is your issue the linked list or determining if a number is prime  use stdlist as your container,1
so show us what you have tried,1
yes  i confused  what steps should i take  ,1
my issue is the linked list  how implement it and insert this number in it ,1
id probably write some code to insert a specified number into a linked list then id write some code to determine whether a number is prime then id generate numbers from 0 to 150 check if theyre prime and if so insert them into the linked list,1
check out this similar question httpstackoverflowcomquestions10350724linkedliststoringprimenumbersfrom1to1000 it will give you an idea about steps you need to take,1

no the distance is 5 but the way hes asking is weird,1
split the sentence by empty space and work with indexes to find out the so called distance,1
 j yes  and when there is zero word between two words the distance between them is 1,1
  thats weird but you can add 1 to the final result according to my solution,1
 j thats not weird thats how distance has always been calculated a and b are 1unit of distance appart in the alphabet etc,1
  the way i am asking is not weird i am simply asking about the distance between two word entities in a corpus what is so weird about that you saying its weird makes you weird,1

do you mean your validation persists although the inputs are valid,1

as for the email validation it does disappear when i try to retype a valid one as for the phone yeah your validation seems wrong,1
  yeah i dont understand why its not dissapearing,1
500 errors are usually solved by looking at the server logs there will certainly be something related to the error there also i hope youre not mixing the mysql and mysqli functions since youve tagged both of them,1

id highly recommend not using while true unless you have to  do you know what it does,1
define the problem specifically whats going wrong where do you think its going wrong what is expected etc,1
aye my teacher semiteaches us haha alright is the problem definately with the while loops then and the problem im having is that i need one of the two characters strength to eventually reach 0 when they die but this isnt happening,1
your problem seems to be the while loop id recommend reading about it httpenwikipediaorgwikiwhileloop what you describe in your first sentence is what i would expect from a while true loop,1
"for example the first part of your code can be simplified to dice1randomrandint 07
    dice2randomrandint 07 because the while true starts a loop that never stops the condition is always true but the break stops it after the first iteration",1
you should provide the error details if any and why you can not make it work,1
rakibul i want my code takes inputs two matrix of size 3  3 and at the end display results with additions,1

yes it show simple matrix but i want addition for ex for 1st array i enter 111 and second 222 and result will be 333 in results matrix,1
u have only one matrix create another and write an add method to  create the addition matrix,1

that jsfiddle is coming back with an error 404 page can you just post the full link,1
please develop more your question,1
the question is well developed jsfiddle is a place where you have 3 boxes for your code html css and javascript the code on tutorial mixes them and he wants to know how to separate it,1
you should pay attention to the warnings the editor is giving you rather than trying to get around them by breaking the url fiddles are certainly welcome but you still need to include the important code snippets within the question text,1
in fact there is an option indicating where the script should be placed in jsfiddle its currently onload in your fiddle you have to change it to wrap in head and everything will be fine httpjsfiddlenettn8xc1 the options are on the left side bar in frameworks  extensions,1
how long it takes to compile depends on many many factors such as the power of your machine the amount of code and the libraries youre using as such its near impossible to answer,1
  quite possibly  another piece of string question depends how fast he can write code,1
i dont think this is right  from what i can tell it refreshes everything on the refresh tab  thats the ops original problem and mine,1

  no it absolutely is not jsfiddle cant replace the content of your question jsfiddle links may supplement a question but they shouldnt be the only useful content in a question,1
no offense to the parliament session of debate here but going through the fiddlei think its pretty excessive code to paste and all of it is relevant ,1
  then the question doesnt belong on stack overflow,1

youre not returning any reference there and you are indeed leaking memory,1
youre returning a copy and then leaking memory so it is indeed dangerous but allowed,1

oh man my bad that was what i did in the class just edited to fix it typo really sorry is it fine now,1
my bad my bad how in the world did i miss it that was the whole point sorry,1
is it safe to do what i did now,1
  even if you changed the function to return int youd still likely leak memory because people dont expect that a int returned from a function was allocated with new so they wont call delete returnedint edit however it is indeed legal a bit obscene but legal in c,1
  fair point mate how about i use a smart unique pointer how about now,1
  depends on what type of smart pointer youre using ,1
  unless youre returning the unique pointer it will go out of scope at the end of your function and delete its allocated memory meaning accessing the address of the returned int will result in undefined behavior,1
please stop editing the question the answer keeps changing depending on your edits because you keep changing the question,1
  sorry but as it stands what you have will definitely result in undefined behavior in fact really only the first post you had would have resulted in a well behaving function from an api standpoint the second edit would have likely resulted in a memory leak,1
jesus christ you guys know way better than our instructors how come man how do i become like one of you and not like my instructor,1
  will the delete returnedint statement mentioned by you take care of deallocating the memory safely,1
with the second version of the code you had before the uniqueptr edit yes,1

but thats obviously not the answer",1
look i know the answer is d i just want to know what the process is,1
read my first comment very carefully,1
why are you multiplying your outputs  you are simply doing a copy of elements from one array to another  no need to multiply anything,1
ok ill write you an answer  give me a moment,1
thankyou rayryeng,1
wrote an answer  thats as verbose as i can get  good luck on your test,1
it works fine to me can you explain what doesnt work  httpjsfiddlenet6rl1tsed you could use inspect elements to see whats going wrong,1
should be working just fine  httpjsfiddlenetbfgrebgc,1
it is correct maybe there is conflict in other parts,1
are you sure youre including the css file properly,1
is it possible some other css is potentially interfering with this,1
post the entire style sheet some other style is overriding this,1
is this the html from your file or the actual output,1
use your browsers dom inspector to see what rules are being applied to those elements it could be something like a important rule elsewhere overriding your css as posted here,1
my guess is rather that this is in the html file but the browser renders it differently since block elements h1 are not allowed inside inline elements span thus the actual output wont have a h1 inside testimonial at least some editors like ckeditor filter such constructs,1
it seems fine can you give a screenshot of your result,1
why do you even need multiple passwords on one domain educate us a little,1

q why are indexes different from regular variables  a they arent  q why doesnt arrayi  arrayi work like arrayi  arrayi  1  a youre relying on all the partial bexpressions in your complex expression to always execute in the same order  sometimes they will sometimes they wont  this is an example of undefined behavior,1
clarify regular variable  the variable i is usually a regular variable,1
why doesnt it work then ,1

an official tutorial is at httpdocsoraclecomjavasetutorialjavajavaoo ,1
an introductory tutorial on java would be a good place to start  interviewers can usually tell if youve never used the technology for which theyre interviewing before,1
maybe the hr just wanted to check your creativity applied to java language,1
i dont think there is a right answer for that,1
because 0 evaluates to false in boolean contexts,1
because 0 is falsey,1
for compatiblity with c 0 is implicitly convertible to false and nonzero is implicitly convertible to true,1
i is the same as i  0 in a boolean expression,1
use for int i  3 empty i to have infinite loop,1
or whiletrue cout  i    if you want to keep the while loop,1

indexofobject,1
how is this the opposite of get,1
suggest you read the javadocs for list httpsdocsoraclecomjavase8docsapijavautillisthtml  should be obvious,1
are you asking how to get index position of that element in your list,1
  with get you input the index and it outputs the object with indexof you input the object and it outputs the index,1
oh ok  in that sense,1
just for the sake of correctness if your objects start as  they are probably lists and not arrays,1

not sure how to print each name with each numbers from the lists for example the first name is test and the first number 1 is 5 then the first number2 is 20 i want that all on one line for each one in the lists,1
if you read how to ask a good questionhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask you may see that is asks you to create a mcve you should show your csv data how you read it into your lists then your expected output what does test 5 20 mean,1
test the name i said that already 5number1 20number2 all of which is inside the list from the csv file,1

yeah you missed the part where your statment question exlusivly refered to a singleton,1
the answer does not say such a thing private constructors are merely a way of enforcing the singleton pattern you only cheat it by having your main inside that class,1
making the constructor private is one of the things you need to do to implement the singleton pattern but its not the only thing and just this by itself does not automatically make it a singleton,1

the condition i  100 is false it should be i  100,1
  why,1
yes one person give the correct information so go with  ,1
  the loop executes as long as the condition is true i  100 is not true when the loop starts so it doesnt execute,1
  you have a backward understanding of how the condition works its not the test for when the loop should stop its the test for when the loop should keep repeating,1
the random numbers are irrelevant youd have the same problem with echo foo,1

please add your html markup we need to see what your standard select element looks like,1
your scripts seem to be floating in no mans land either put them in your head or your body not between them not sure if thatll make any difference though,1
what makes you think the body is stored as a hexadecimal byte string what even is a hexadecimal byte string there is no such thing,1
that is one heavy misconception take a hexdump tool and you can get the same kind of output out of any file that is just a textual representation,1
  you can check chromecache in chrome or aboutcache in firefox there the browser is showing the cache data and there they are showing a hexadecimal version so the question is why they are doing that,1
  correct they are showing it in that format that doesnt mean its stored in that format,1
  but if its just a textual representation then the question is why they are doing that they can also just only show the non hex version,1
  how would they display images videos binary files executables archives installation files,1
you asked why the browser is storing the data in a hexadecimal string which is not true if you want to ask why it shows the data that way then please edit your question,1
"  i only have that kind of information from other places on the internet so thats why i wanted to know more about it because i already thought maybe its incorrect see httpsgchqgithubiocyberchef

i typed what is apostrophe in visual basic and got this link as the first result httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenusvbalanguagereferencevbaarticleswritingvisualbasicstatements comments can explain a procedure or a particular instruction to anyone reading your code visual basic ignores comments when it runs your procedures comment lines begin with an apostrophe    or with rem followed by a space and can be added anywhere in a procedure to add a comment to the same line as a statement insert an apostrophe after the statement followed by the comment,1
  they could also search apostrophe or equivalent in their language as evidenced by jacob,1

im willing to bet theres an infinite loop here because entry is never reassigned in the loop,1
 is logical or so one of those two conditions is always true   is logical and and what you are looking for,1
you have a break outside of your switch this breaks out of your loop but theres several issues here such as your while loop condition and with getting the user input also,1
you probably would have caught the issue that   mentions if you had formatted the code yourself  it sticks out like a sore thumb,1

you need to call the method name not the variable name,1
txt is not a field of object the poorly named variable set1 should be of type arraylistarraylistabc never use raw types,1
you solve the problem already on the very next line of code  your nongeneric arraylist is not by default of type abc but you can cast the elements to that type,1
the real point here is this is basic syntax dont try to do trial and error read a good book or tutorial and follow that  instead of inventing your own syntax,1

a is undeclared isnt a bug youll have bugs later when your code compiles here it seems that a is declared in a different not global scope than the function hence invisible,1
btw a has the type int 1010 so after adjusting to a pointer this is int 10 and not int  as your function expects,1
the variable a in sumaij is not being declared nor initialized at that moment the compiler tries to find it but it is unable to do so perhaps you made a typo or wanted to use another variable,1

yes number u have mentioned are valid  ,1
update your post to include rules you use to decide what is valid and what is not,1
yes number u have mentioned are valid i also mentioned 1234500 which has four digits after  so can we assume that  can have any number of digits after it like 12345600 would such number be valid or there is some rule which invalidates it if so what rule is it,1

unclear what youre asking i also feel wrong with assigning a pointer to array,1
is it possible to define your own variable type and then use it as any other variable well thats one of the purposes of c,1
can you show the code that you would like to write as it stands the question is completely unclear,1
  thats initializating a char array from a string literal that does not exceed the size of the array not assignment it is valid,1
the whole point of struct is to define your own types so you are pretty much asking if you can define your own types without doing what is required to define your own type,1
what typeidaname returns is not defined by c it is down to the compiler writers it can be different for every compiler,1
you have it in my answer ,1
oh nice thanks,1
yeah i dont want to use stuct doesnt look good then use a language whose syntax suits you better aesthetically,1

heres a novel idea dont actually send the email until its ready to be sent just store it somewhere until its ready,1
ok i am not asking anybody to do my job just asking if there is anybody that has done something like what i am asking the reason i posted the question is because looking here httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysystemnetmailsmtpclientvvs110aspx there is no onsend or beforesend or something like that the smtpclient class only provides sendcompleted event,1
"youll need a way to intercept the message first how is the message being sent can you host a smart relay that does this do you need to program something new to do it or do any existing tools already perform this functionality there are lots of smart smtp servers out there

what exactly is the question again",1
  and joedm i just edited the question hope it is clear now,1
incidentally i assume that this is an email client you wrote or otherwise control the code of or are you trying to do an outlook plugin or something like that this is a very different question if youre trying to do this with a third party tool like outlook,1
also do you control the smtp servers,1
i have already done a plugin for outlook that does the same very big difference is that outlook object model do expose an itemsend event that allows me to cancel the sending operation i am trying to generalize the solutions to all mail clients that is why i ran into this and no i do not have any control on the smtp server,1
just to clarify is this line 9 xx2 also what is the purpose of this ifx1 cixdo you wan to compare the values or assign them,1
line no 9 is this int checkbitx  and as for ifx1 cix  i want to break the while when x reaches 1 because aside from the modulus i am also dividing x by 2 so when x reaches 1 at the end i want to store that one in the array and break the while loop,1
well in that case  faust as others have mentioned below it should be int checkbitint x the first int being the return type of the method and the second int being the type of the parameter passed in,1

have you heard of or tried looking at linqpad i find it quite useful for things like this,1
in two cases youre returning a pointer that doesnt come from malloc,1
πάνταῥεῖ this question use method so this is c,1
you want to return null in case something went wrong and not a pointer to an unfreeable string literal like you do here return charmalloc,1
well to be fair im not doing anything with the return  charmalloc its just there for completeness it hangs after the very first call which returns the string succesfully but then hangs on freeidqueuestring,1
by the way this is very bad cast because you remove the read only attribute of char const ,1
why does it matter i only added that in the code for my question it actually returns null in my code and should never actually reach that address because i only use 5248 bits of ram out of 128kb,1
  you also have a code path that does returnstring  charempty i suggest you use a debugger to find your bugs,1
how am i not returning a pointer can you potentially tell me what its actually returning because it sure looks like a pointer returnstring to me,1
oh interesting i had a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of casting to char then what is a minimal way for doing the empty line i have it as a series of returnstringqueuelength  e  returnstringqueuelength  0 and that seems pretty cumbersome in terms of number of lines of code,1
also why did people vote my question down lol,1
doing strcpyreturnstring empty will copy the string literal to the char array you allocated that will fix a single problem you probably still need to take a careful look at the rest of your code,1
people vote your question down maybe because you dont provide a code that can reproduce you problem best to have mcvehttpsstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,1
  whats wrong with the rest of it sorry and yea im tired on a saturday night guess that was the obvious answer ,1

char c  s0 c  toupperc here c initially holds a copy of the first character of the string then its reassigned to hold some other value the original string remains unchanged on the other hand if you write char c  s0 then c is a reference  an alias  to the first character of the string assigning to c is the same as assigning to s0 same thing happens in your loop,1

looks like something a compiler would need to do if parsing source code and checking for correctness are you looking for these patterns in strings  you probably need something with backreferences  and positivenegative  lookaheads if the last backref found is a  you look for positive lookahead of  or none of them and negative lookahead of   similar for the others still wondering if parsing via regexx is the thing to do here,1
you could improve on this answer httpsstackoverflowcoma53576177505395 and build an iterative regex parser for your string  using an error to bail out if mismatched parentheses are found,1
please edit this question to explain what regexes youve tried and how they didnt work hint the balanced parenthesis problem is a classic example to illustrate the limitations of regular expressions – you need some kind of stack to keep track of currently open brackets many regex engines such as pythons re cannot match these patterns but the python regex module and the perl regex engine can be used because they support recursive patterns,1
can you at least comment on the answers already given as of now you just asked how to identify valid and invalid patterns and gave examples what you consider valid or invalid but you didnt say what exactly you want to match and what not you asked for a regex or to make code for match this patterns together with your latest comment then may be heshe has not much knowledge about regular expression and string this translates to give me the codes and if youre too dumb then dont downvote things you dont know of,1

okay is the html,1

will you need to input a series of dance steps  that is will there ever be multiple lines giving d1 through dn,1
no it will always be one line the set of dance moves repeats supposedly infinitely many times,1
the output here will be 3 because there will always be people in spaces 1 2 and 3 no because with your current example the result is 3 after the first time the sequence is executed but becomes 2 after the second time the sequence is executed after that it stays constant at 2,1
say the order of the people before any execution is just 1 2 3 4 then after one execution according to the mapping above i think it should become 2 3 1 4 empty subsequently following the same mapping it becomes 3 1 4 2 empty and so on this is my understanding of the problem however the inputoutput above is provided spots 13 are always occupied,1
well first of all the numbers in your example input and your subsequent analysis dont line up but if i go with your example input lets say that initially theres one person on every position 1 1 1 1 after iteration one this becomes 1 2 1 0 after iteration two this becomes 2 2 0 0 subsequent iterations no longer change this result,1
yes sorry i just realized this and i have edited the question you are correct that for the example input the answer should have been 2 now updated to match analysis,1
same scenario for the new example input 1 1 1 1  2 1 1 0  3 1 0 0 then stabilizes,1
do the numbers represent the number of people on the corresponding index here if so it should be 1 1 1 1  1 1 2 0  2 1 1 0  1 1 2 0,1
are you talking about the result after every move or after every full sequence of moves,1
the full sequence of moves the last index in the example no longer be mapped after the first iteration since nobody is occupying that spot,1
then i dont see how you get to those results if we look at the execution of the steps in only the first sequence i have 1 1 1 1  0 1 2 1  0 1 2 1  2 1 0 1  2 1 1 0 so i dont see how you get to 1 1 2 0 after the first iteration,1
i am getting 1 1 1 1  1 1 2 0 each person is mapped to the corresponding index in 3 2 1 3 which means that the first index in 1 1 1 1 goes to index 3 the second one goes to index 2 and the third one goes to index 1 the last one also goes to index 3 since there is no 4 in the dancing moves array nothing is mapped to the last index in the array which means that it is at zero,1
think you missed a part in your assignment this means that they will move together for the rest of the remaining dances,1
hmm the example inputoutput i have currently in op is provided to me with output of 3 i believe that after arriving at 1 1 2 0 it follows 3 2 1 3 again the first index 1 is mapped to the 3rd index the second index also 1 is mapped to the second index the third index 2 is mapped to the first index since there is nobody at the last spot it cannot be mapped which gives 2 1 1 0 no matter how many times the people follow this set of dance moves the first three places remain occupied i think that all of the mappings be thought of as instantaneously occuring,1
hmmmm that changes things wouldnt the solution then just always be arraysstreammovesdistinctcount,1
a counterexample n  4 dancing moves  1 1 2 3 here the we would have the sequence 1 1 1 1  2 1 1 0  3 1 0 0  4 0 0 0 so the output would be 1 whereas the line of code outputs 3,1
i think that your idea of snapshotting might work what if every snapshot were stored into an array or something and once we get a snapshot that we have already arrived at we can conclude that it has stabilized it will begin to cycle then then we can count the number of nonzero elements and that should be the answer,1

unless those are variable names that isnt valid code,1
if you literally have a list list1  home  school ground field youll get nameerror simply trying to run the code,1
where is list1  home  school ground field  coming from are you reading it from a text file or standard input as others have said that line is not valid in a python script unless home school etc are variables that already exist,1
if it is home  school ground field then you can use split to get a valid list,1
i know the code will give error i just want to know if there is any method or module to convert list1 to proper python list thank you,1
no those are not variables   2ring,1
if that line is in a python script then the script wont run due to the syntaxerror so it wont be able to do anything,1
as   where does it come from you will be able to create this list of strings without going via this intermediate list of variable names,1
thanks all for your answers,1
well you cannot convert something which is invalid syntax maybe you mean having the string list1  home  school ground field and converting it to a list you can use list111split  the 11 gets rid of the opening and closing keys,1
but if you are reading that as a string from some text file or user input then you can easily create a valid list,1
  if that line is in a python script then the script wont run due to the syntaxerror youre using undefined variables but its still syntactically correct,1
  good catch you are perfectly correct that line will raise nameerror not syntaxerror,1

dictionarystring liststring may work one key to a list value this wont look like your expected tho,1
   but it wont give the expected json,1
would multiple savecontactmethodfoo be even valid json if that is what you want,1
   its a valid json but it produce warning warningduplicate key names should be unique,1
  i was thinking the same thing thats not valid json because you have duplicate property names,1
 balamanigandan so its not valid json then,1
   warning is different than error the said format is a valid json,1
does not work key value would never have duplicate key if you can have duplicate key use of keyvaluepair is meaning less,1
   yeah i need a better solution for this anyone please assist me,1
dictionarystring liststring would be what you need as initially mentioned,1
maybe you need to talk to your client and explain to them this is a stupid requirement likely to introduce all sorts of problems down the road,1
yes technically that is valid json however its meaning according to the spec is that preceding duplicate keys are ignored hence the warnings in your online tools the json is invalid if you care about the integrity of your data since you do care about the integrity you can no longer call it json its now your own custom format that happens to resemble json,1
   here the question is returning json with duplicate keys not for parsing first try to understand the requirement of the question then reply,1
 balamanigandan im talking about the poor guy who will have to parse the output you are creating not about you ,1
any time you find yourself saying i need a duplicate key i think its time to rethink your design,1
theres nary a char in the code you show i for one have no idea what you are talking about why again is it surprising that a function with return type of int can return a value of type int,1
a is an int the function is returning an int would you still think a was a char if you changed its name to aaaaa,1
generally speaking arent az characters,1
isnt a also a variable in python,1
a is a char but a is not try return a or replacing int a with char a and see how far you get,1
 ưuvĩnhphúc what do you mean by that a can be used as a variable but by default a is not defined,1
  yes i mean it can be used as an identifier in python just like in c and it cant be a character in python,1
i mistakenly thought this was a meaningful question and voted to reopen i just took the ops assertion about the function and didnt read the code ,1
and it cant be a character in python  yes it can a is perfectly valid python expression,1
  of course its a valid python express just like its a valid c expression because its a valid identifier but its not a valid character string how do you print a and expecting it to print the letter a to console without setting a  a first,1

instead of decrypting the existing password its better you do one of the following things 1 generate a new password and send it to user wha should change this upon login 2 provide an interface to user to enter new password encrypt this and replace it in your db,1
better to hash passwords not encrypt them,1
encrypting passwords is really bad for security you can find the encryption keys if you spend a few hours analysing the apk,1
  then what do you suggest that should be done for password security instead of encryptiondecryption,1
as   said use hashing not encryption,1
do not encrypt passwords when the attacker gets the db he will also get the encryption key iterate over an hmac with a random salt for about a 100ms duration and save the salt with the hash use functions such as passwordhash pbkdf2 bcrypt and similar functions the point is to make the attacker spend a lot of time finding passwords by brute force,1
this is the reason why banks and other secure websites never email you your password they email you a link to reset your password  because if they did security right even they dont know what your password actually is,1
"your suggestions seems great but since i have no experience in these kind of stuff could you guys please suggest some urls or sample code where this hashing or bcrypt is done 
also i cant change the flow as this is what the given requirement is so android and java code needs to be in the same page in this password security stuff same method should be able to run on both sides   sola",1

httpsdocsoraclecomjavasetutorialjavanutsandboltsforhtml,1
java uses curly braces not indentation to mark blocks also is that all of your code if so there is a lot missing in order for it to compile plus your for loop is totally broken,1
what are you trying to accomplish,1
guys take it easy on the down votes  everyone started somewhere,1
thank you edwin,1
in the university didnt learn us how to use the debugger and i can understand just by youtube videos,1
you do not have a return 0 statement at the end of main  how is main going to return anything without a return statement,1
nonvoid functions must return something,1
  main has an implicit return 0,1
  in c main will implicitly return 0 if no return statement is encountered its a rule unique to main,1
the programm compiles with no errors  but i bet you had warnings about returning nothing from a function that is supposed to return something like your setweaponname function  the code asis invokes undefined behavior due to this issue,1
  while true by pointing that out to a novice programmer you are encouraging sloppy programming  if the desire is for a value to be returned it should be explicitly done and not rely on implicit behavior  implicit behavior can come later when the program actually works,1
i put return 0 on main and a return to the other fuctions but i have still the same problem,1
  bs theres nothing sloppy about omitting a return 0 from main if you actually write return 0  id have to ask if you knew what you were doing you are actually confusing a new comer by implying main needs an explicit return statement and that their code is faulty for not having it,1
once i clean up all of the setter functions that return nothing by replacing the return type with void i get a tonne of errors good odds that all of the invalid functions confused the heck out of the  compiler and produced a completely batsmurf program,1
put return 0 on main and a return to the other functions but i have still the same problem  without changing what i mentioned those problems will remain,1
  its a necessary requirement for the homework to put setters and getters,1
just remember that there is almost never a reason for a setter function to have to return anything,1
whole bunch of free functionshttpsstackoverflowcomquestions4861914whatisthemeaningofthetermfreefunctioninc accessing private class members you cant do that,1
  well its silly you should ask whoever set those requirements and see if they come back with something better than the usual its good practice nonsense,1
recommendation dont write so much code at a time write a few lines maybe a function then compile if you have enough to test test it but do not proceed until you have no compiler errors no compiler errors and your testing finds no bugs if you let any of these build up they tend to interact with one another making it harder to sort out whats a real bug and whats an artifact of another bug,1
what do you mean by returns 3221225477 the program prints that thats the exit code i notice 3221225477 is 0xc0000005  that might mean something,1
here is a working code  cppsh46j35 the main and only problem was with your setters return type should be void  i have no idea why that even compiled,1
tactical point expanding on   s comment if a variable has a getter and a setter and the setter does nothing to protect the variable from someone injecting a bad value you might as well make the variable public and remove the setter and getter setters are all about the object protecting itself if its not protecting itself the setter is just more code that can have a bug in it,1
  i didnt write all in once but khow i put the duelforyoungsamurais or the pickweapon parts in comment and i have the same problem,1
  i think the program blew up and the cause more than likely is not addressing the compiler warnings about returning nothing from nonvoid  functions,1
"  it prints samurai ready for duel
samurai ready for duel
weapon created


process exited after 3735 seconds with return value 3221225477
press any key to continue   ",1
somehow that mass of nonreturning functions that should be returning  successfully hides a raft of coding mistakes that are errors in gcc 485 and 492 no idea how,1
  it didnt have any code on your comment attached,1
heres something i didnt see earlier  friend string duelforyoungsamuraissamurai a samurai b but duelforyoungsamurais is defined as void duelforyoungsamuraissamurai a samurai b since the return types are different they arent the same function so  the implementation of duelforyoungsamurais cannot access the private members,1
  the code contains no pointers no arrays no calls to new etc  so the only thing i can see that would cause it to not work is and this is the third time mentioning this  your functions that are marked as returning string that fail to return a string are the most likely cause for the errors  playing around commenting out things is not going to fix that problem  either make those functions void or return a string,1

im still willing to help,1
  thank you its an assignment  also im not allowed to use structures or classes for the program,1
  code is in the link to the paste bin what other reasons,1
"i cleaned up the formatting a bit including for the code  follow the pattern for indenting that i used in main to make the code more readable  that might help remove some of these down votes  

now if im understanding correctly are you looking to print the age of every reservation for a given sport",1
  yes so if a user enters the char f for flying all the reservations that fall under that category within the sporttypeindex of char f would be printed out with their corresponding ages so if a patron age 18 who entered f was in the array it would print a patron aged 18 reserved a session of flying,1
  the main reason we would like all information pertinent to the question in the question is so that the question can stand the test of time if the information is stored at another site it can rothttpsenwikipediaorgwikilinkrot and this question will be rendered useless to people with the same or similar problems in the future a common second reason is we dont know what nasty things may be lurking at an off site link and may not be interested in finding out the hard way one evil flash banner can ruin your whole day,1
off topic editing the code i notice many functions claim to return a value eg int inputageint patronage int index but do not contain a return statement this will lead to no small amount of grief it is syntactically valid but is logically undefined and the compiler can do absolutely nothing or generate whatever code it wishes including seemingly correct code to do something your compiler should be warning you about this,1
thanks for the edits of the code      it sounds like what you want to do is search the array of sports for all indices that contain a particular value  in other words loop through sporttype and capture every index that leads to a certain character,1
  thanks for the heads up i will post the code directly in the future should i alter the functions to return instead of setting them equal in the inputnewreservation function my compiler didnt give me any warnings so i didnt realize this would impact my program operation,1
  so syntatically am i looking at something along the lines of a for loop that goes int i  0 i  size i  if sporttypeindex  insert char here print out message  with size being a counter variable that i set in main to increment each time a new reservation and thus an indices of the array is set,1
you have it recommend generalizing the function a bit and passing in insert char here and a string containing a longer description of the sport as parameters that way you only have to write one function for all sports,1
and dont forget to post the final code here so that others can find it in the future,1
compiler warnings sometimes need to be enabled in visual studio open the properties and navigate configuration properties ccgeneral and play with the warning level in gcc add a wall to the command line or play with the gui of whatever ide youre using to set the command line for you youll have to look that up yourself because there are dozens of them,1
and part three in inputreservation the line sporttypeindex  inputtypesporttype index counts on inputtype returning the correct value so currently the code blows itself up by not returning ideologically a function should do only one thing so input should just take input and hand that input off to someone who knows how best to store it the simpler a function is the easier it is to debug so char inputtypechar sporttype int index should probably be char inputtype read the user input into a temporary value test the value and return the value when its good,1
  i edited with my current revisions my program is currently running as far as letting the user enter the desired reservation type and patron age but is not printing anything when the user enters 2 i will revise again with the changes you suggested about changing the functions,1
the short answer is you have no print statement in the function that handles option 2 youll learn a lot more figuring out what the print statement has to look like than you will from being fed a canned answer so im going to walk away at this point,1
  alright well thanks for your help,1

im voting to close this question as offtopic because its about semantics and not programming,1
but this place is for java or ,1
see httpdocsoraclecomjavasetutorialjavaiandiabstracthtml for a quick lesson on abstract classes,1
  abstract in this case has nothing to do with abstract classes thats the whole point of the question,1
  oops my bad,1
  i disagree if documentation says abstract on a nonabstract class it is a legitimate question,1
  a legitimate question sure for httpenglishstackexchangecom,1
divone  ok where are you stuck ,1
here you go h3,1
then which time zone do you want to format in,1
neither timezone is unknown,1
then date isnt what you want as that represents an instant in time which only has a local yearmonthdayhourminutesecond when you apply a time zone the same instant has different values in different time zones and they dont make sense without a time zone its like asking for the binary encoding of a string without specifying an encoding,1
  no date represents measure of time it can mean one instant in one timezone and another instant in another,1
  no its like asking a distance without specifying an origin we have double type which holds this nobody requires to provide units of measurement and origin for doubles the same should be for datetime,1
  no it really doesnt date is an instant in time  a number of milliseconds since the unix epoch its not since some arbitrary point in time  it has a wellspecified origin the longer you fight against this the longer you will have problems please accept it if you dont believe me you should read the javautildate documentation which starts the class date represents a specific instant in time with millisecond precision,1
your code is correct you are also correct that it depends on your jvms time zone and for the same date object will produce differnt results in different time zones exactly therefore you need to specify for which time zone you want the result,1
if all you have is a point in absolute time relative to unix timestamp there is no way to format it without a time zone because that will display as a different time in different time zones  where and in what format does your value come from,1
  suppose it is in shire,1
  what are you saying does imply utc,1
  if you have a timezone you can specify that timezone and you wont have a problem,1
  i have no timezone i have hhmmss from third party source its timezone if unknown and may mean different instant than one i get if parse this string,1
  see my very simple example code showing that date is not instant,1
  it not only format matter you can also call gethours getter and see the same date is just not an instance if you use its components in any way and you use it in numerous cases for example if you read date from database server by clients all over the world you will get the same components but different gettime,1
iow you dont have an absolute time  you want httpsdocsoraclecomjavase8docsapijavatimelocaltimehtml,1
your tests dont show what you seem to think it shows youre parsing it in the system default time zone and constructing 19700101t000001 in the system default time zone however im done here youre ignoring both what the documentation says and what someone with considerably experience in datetime work says youre welcome to do that of course but youre not going to make any progress you should follow slaks advice and use localtime as thats what the value youre receiving represents it doesnt represent an unambiguous instant in time,1
  and you are ignoring how date is used in numerous libraries and tools i am done here too,1
  i dont want absolute time i want relative time,1
then you want localtime or localdatetime as thats precisely what they model,1
a date only contains an instant whether it contains a correct instance well if it contains an incorrect one it certainly wouldn’t be the first time in you socalled proof it contains an instant of 2 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds before the epoch — which in turn tells me you jvm’s time zone is at an offset of 3 hours from utc,1
dims i believe the real answer to your question is stay away from javautildate it confuses you and there’s no reason why you should want that use the newer classes in javatime instead like those   mentions,1
i dont want absolute time i want relative time i think what you are looking for is duration or period from javatime even so numerous libraries and tools use date doesnt mean its correct,1
 öhrl that depends on relative to what if relative to a time zone jon skeet’s suggestion is better if relative between two points in time you are entirely correct,1
 öhrl i agree it is not correct this is my point and it is not an instant but it is dual second nature of date appears not in formatting only but in many cases,1
 v absolutely just wanted to throw those into the field as they havent mentioned yet  dims this simply shows that time is a very complex field jon skeet is an expert there trust him,1
i agree in your view that the date class was designed with a “second nature” i just meant to say the state a date object holds is an instant only the second nature is in constructors the methods particularly the many deprecated methods but also in tostring this design is generally considered poor in retrospect and is one of the reasons new classes were designed twice first calendar and later all the javatime classes,1
  assume you have a date object created by expression new date601000 what is the expected string you want to generate from this,1
 v according to oop paradigm the internals of object is black box the true nature of object  is what you can get from it or set to it by its methods you cant say that some of methods are true and another methods are false the matter of fact is that date class has two contracts regardless the number of downvotes and regardless documentation there are a lot of libraries that read datetime and present it in date format for java in this moment the contract of number of milliseconds from unix era is violated,1
  in my situation i am receiving date time from another source and it is constructed from parts and i need to print exactly these parts your case is irrelevant,1
  if the date is constructed from say year month day in month hrs and min and you cannot guess the time zone used when constructing it there is no way you can fulfil the requirement of printing those parts from the date,1
  ok assume you have a date object created by expression new date70 0 1 0 1 0 what is the expected string you want to generate from this,1
  something like 19700101 000100 order should depend on format but components should be kept,1
 v please understand that timezone should not be part of date because date should measure time while timezone is a measure for space we are not storing kilograms meters and so on units in double and whe should not keep timezone in date,1
your update 4 only proves that gethours reflects the local time zone which you are changing  if one repeatedly evaluates ab and gets different sums when changing b that doesnt mean that a is also changing,1
  but this means that ab contains also b but not only a,1
contains is the wrong word but sure ab is dependent on both a and b in the same way that the hour returned from gethours is dependent on both the instant held by the date object and the local time zone  that does not mean that the instant changes when you change the time zone no more than it means that a changes when you change b,1
also you say in the sample hours property  however dategethours is a method not a property  java doesnt have properties in the same way that c has it only has methodshttpstackoverflowcoma2963249634824  a method that takes as input some outside information cannot be described as purehttpstackoverflowcoma22395430634824  therefore what you are observing is simply that the gethours method is impure because it takes the system time zone as one of its inputs,1
"  expression ab namely contains b you may say depends on but you cant say contains is wrong 

i never said instant changes i only said date contains not only instant and this is true date is the same as ab in your excellent example where a is an instant and b is timezone

in terms of java bean convention gethours is a property getter for property hours i may rewrite access to this property with any bean library the fact that getters in java do not have additional brace level changes nothing

of course you may say gethours is impure",1
i believe that it is finally clear what the problem is here if class a has a method getdata and this getdata method is returning a internal state which is an instant modified by some external value lets skip the timezone lets say its users screen resolution does this make a an instant or not and does this imply that a stores screen resolution or not  i believe that this is simply semantics thing  how you define what is an instant it seems that most people define instant differently from the questions author,1
  i understand instant as a point on time dimension i dont deny date contains instant i deny it is an instant we may say it is impure instant if you wish the very fact that date has so much depreated methods and that there are so many alternative implementations alone proves that javautildate is both impure and bad design,1
ok i understand what you mean  but can you refer to the example with screen resolution if the class with a private instant field would have a getdata method which would return value based on local screen resolution or any other environmental data would that mean that it is not instant just want to make sure that i get your instant definition right i believe that a game changer here would be to provide a definition of an instant from some trustful source because the discussion is about instants and nobody posted any definition yet,1
  it depends on whether it is possible to reach instant pure if the class would have only getdata which returns only instant dirtied with screen resolution i would say either it is not instant or some special sort of instant defined by class designer i am opened to any definition but it should not drift,1

trying to configure displaystartuperrors at runtime might not make the most sense though manual lists it as phpiniall changeable  but i think we are past the “startup sequence” at this point,1

  the sense is to make the application display errors if i check the development checkbox at login form if i dont check the session var will be null so errors display will be 0,1
what you want to achieve with this is clear but i doubt trying to set displaystartuperrors at this point makes any sense  we are probably a bit beyond the php “startup sequence” as the manual calls it as this point,1

hard to believe post the stack trace and what is containerlist,1
how can it throw npe impossible because you already created the hashmap object  new hashmapstring container,1
if ifcontainermapcontainskeycontainergetname throws a nullpointerexception either containermap or container are null,1
containerlist was a misstake by me i fixed that but thats not related to the problem i will add the exception and the method in a second,1
theres most likely a mistake in your code as its hard to believe noone would notice this sort of bug until now in either way the minimum would be the code to reproduce the problem and probably the jreversion,1
i could totally image my code having misstakes but the thing is i run the first version npe i add the check if the hashmap size is 0 and it works exactly as it should  absolutly no changes to the other objects involved,1
please provide a mcvehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve otherwise this question is pretty useless as theres no way for us to see where the error comes from in either way the problem is definitely not related to hashmapcontainskey as the stacktrace shows the npe is thrown in your code not in the implementation of hashmap,1
i vote to remove that question at all before make such statement it is good at least debug a code and run simple test over the hashmap test shows hashmap works fine which means in turn your code is bad somewhere,1

312000  12  4  6500  and converting to hourly divide weekly by the number of hours worked in a week typically 375 or 40 see answer below noting there are not 4 weeks per month so divide yearly by 52 rather than 48,1
this only makes sense if the payroll system calculates weekly amounts  mine pays biweekly so there are 26 paychecks per year  others do bimonthly 15th and last day of the month so there are 24 paychecks per year  i weep for our collective mathematical ability that such a simple unit conversion requires a question on so,1
thanks for the input mark but i really need an answer on this one,1
ok ive updated the post with my code mark,1
second of all this isnt homework im attempting to learn on my own,1
when you run this what do you get  what do you actually want to get  i ask because there are at least two errors that prevent it from even running,1
all i get is the list of random numbers which is fine the only thing im struggling on is counting any kind of repetition,1
the code you posted doesnt run  and repetition of what  if you had 12233334 what result do you want two repetitions  or the count of two 2s and four 3s  please clarify your question,1
every time a number repeats any number the counter variable should be increased by one,1
so again what is the answer you want with my example  4  because 2 is repeated once and 3 is repeated 3 more times for a total of 4  do you see why i asked to clarify your question  it is completely unclear  give a clear example of what you want  and your code still doesnt run,1
yes that is exactly it,1
so next time include that kind of information in your questions  give examples and explain how you want the result to look  also post code that can be cutnpasted and run  your example doesnt work and implies you manually typed it and didnt run it,1
i dont know what the problem is but its idiomatic to write expressions such as sentence  a as the equivalent sentencea  your program would probably be more readable if you used that idiom,1
and getlength seems to be just your own implementation of strlen  are you not allowed to use strlen in your work second you have a delims string but you only ever use the first character in it,1
this program cannot possibly run  there is no main function,1
you should be using a debugger to diagnose and fix problems like this,1
this is not true i use  everywhere in my code and when rendering twig and i never had an issue with it,1
where did you get this misinformation from,1
you should include your code in your questions otherwise is very hard for people to help you and they will down vote the question httpsstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask,1
this is not a particularly hard regex to write if you have tried and failed to solve this problem independently please describe your latest attempt that has failed,1

im voting to close this question as offtopic because it is about content licensing not programming please contact your attorney for assistance in interpreting content licenses and how best to respect them in your jurisdiction,1
to begin with i recommend you do some research about emulating pass by reference in c to continue what will the new elements of img be after the reallocation hint they are uninitialized and cant be passed as is to realloc lastly you should never assign back to the pointer you pass to realloc in case realloc fails,1
this is not a 2d array and the logic is flawed first free individual arrays that are no longer needed if any then resize your array of pointers then allocate newly needed individual arrays and resize those that were there before and of course check for errors on each malloc  realloc call finally modifying a local variable modifies a copy you have to eg return img when youre done,1
and in general but it is not working is not a suitable problem description,1
h is not defined anywhere,1
correctly allocating multidimensional arrayshttpsstackoverflowcomquestions42094465correctlyallocatingmultidimensionalarrays,1
  if resizing in more than one dimension should work preserving the contents a real multidimensional array wont fit the bill,1
  no but the op has a misconception that their code is allocating 2d arrays,1
this code doesnt make any sense srcptr  srcadr sets the pointer to point at the address of srcadr not to point at the absolute address 0x105fc080 furthermore nobody can answer this question without seeing the variable declarations,1
also what does this have to do with embedded systems smart pointers and void pointers,1
also to begin with this code is incorrect for updating raw memory locations since you dont use the volatile qualifier,1
besides the other mentioned problems what about just making a copy before you start modifying your pointer,1
what am i missing in this code is not a proper question see httpsstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask,1
why do you think you are missing something,1
a call to printmenu ,1
well im not getting an output from any of the if and else if statements i was thinking probably i had to add on a systemoutprint but i dont know exactly what would go inside the parentheses,1
its not clear what youre asking do you want the user to be able to open the second app from the first do you want to turn the two projects into one somehow,1

start by learning to use vim without your mouse,1
force yourself not to use the mouse you will learn vims navigation shortcuts better that way also vim is designed to be inefficient youre supposed to glue together lots of strange tricks to navigate files this glueing of slow commands means vim is more configurable but harder to use than a modern editor,1
what do you mean am i using a i use i to go into insert how do i use vim without the mouse,1
well i starts the insertion before the cursor and a starts the insertion after the cursor this cheat sheethttpsvimrtorrcom might be handy,1

  i somewhat disagree vim is a tool used primarily for programming which disqualifies the offtopic close reason general usage,1
  i disagree that vim is primarily a programming tool i think its primarily a text editor which can be programmed and used for writing programs but neither are the focus of this question,1
try httpsvimadventurescom   for learning vim  learn to not touch your mouse or any arrow keys,1
did you use vimtutor to start it sounds like you skipped that thirty minute intro,1
  vim is not designed to be inefficient the opposite is true its designed in a very different way then most editors to be more efficient,1
vim is a text editor not a code editor its designed to glue small commands together to do simple navigation like 10j wordcr tf etc which are composable for doing large repetitive tasks but intentionally inefficient for day to day navigating,1

  you can call static method from non static method but cant define in non static,1

it will run infinitely check httpstackoverflowcomquestions24278724purposeofwhile1statementinc,1
you can use a debugger to find out whats going on,1
try put the cin instruction in the loop to let the user a chance to update the commandinput value on each loop,1
of course it runs infinitely the contents of the loop keep checking the same variables hoping that their values would somehow magically change on their own of course c doesnt work this way theres nothing inside the while loop that will change the values in the variables as such each iteration of the loop will always come up with the same results,1
have you tried stepping through the code using a debugger,1
commandinput  invreport this is not how you compare two strings,1
you return a value from checkdata that does not automatically return and abort the code in changemode youre not doing anything with the return value from checkdata youre literally calling checkdata and then unconditionally call gotothen each and every time,1

the hard part here being me yes id like this translated to swift from objectivec i dont always believe the documentation and its not always up to date  ,1
i see this part as well as you httpsdeveloperapplecomreferencecoreimagecifilter1438145filternames the difference is that i dont know how to turn that into working code nor where to write it to get an output  ,1
ok   but how do i change the documentations code into actual code,1
 anth i cant make this code work no matter what i do i dont know where an output goes im,1
post what you have tried,1
  does nil in your example mean every single category,1
  no it means i have a very hard time translating method signatures into actual code a very hard time which might well mean the same thing or that i have enormous trouble with all programming languages and all documentation of all languages if method signatures and their hieroglyphics means something to you good for you,1
trying something and it giving the desired result doesnt mean its doing so for the reasons im presuming im having to presume nil means all categories because well nothings ever explicitly explained is it,1
and without knowing all the possible filters how could i determine if nil is giving me all the categories of results my gut feeling is that nil would give an output of all filters that dont belong to categories  ,1
  the answers to all your questions are in my original question the comments and via a search through my so answers and questions a question to you does this question in your opinion need a mcve,1
yes what have you tried why are you refusing to show how you attempted to translate objectivec to swift and if you have what exactly is the issue give me something i can reproduce   an be blunt to the point of hard to cope but you extended things  your op is it new i was writing a comment when it suddenly turned into an answer that now is a screenshot of the op  to the point of getting personal in your op thats not a good question worse it still shows no code whatsoever,1
translating method signatures is a mostly mechanical task and you can get the documentation to do a lot of the work for you since you can switch it back and forth between objectivec and swift people are downvoting you because they dont like being asked to do such “trivial” work based on your historyhttpstackoverflowcomusers2109038confusedtabquestionssortactivitypage4 youve been learning swift for over two years at this point its time for you to learn some objectivechttpstwittercomrmayoffstatus746873762616750080,1

edit your question and insert your code there its not readable in a comment,1
what do you mean by not working what tests did you run whats the output,1
javascript  java,1
whats your main method looks like add input and expected output,1
im going to guess in your main method you created a vendingmachine with 20 cans or 10 cans and add10 cans then inserttokenx2 theres your output,1
its because of machineadd10 either delete it or rewrite your expected count,1
why do you expect tokencount to be 0 in first place,1
"here is my teachers requirement for the codeprovide two constructors for the vendingmachine class
1 a default constructor vendingmachine that initializes the vending machine with
10 soda cans
2 a constructor vendingmachineint cans that initializes the vending machine
with the given number of cans
both constructors should initialize the token count to 0",1
it does what its supposed to do,1
im just trying to figure out what correction should i make in order to let the token count to be 0,1
in what scenario if youre trying to simulate a vending machine i guess each can should have a price and then when you insert tokens it accumulates them until it reached that price then youd zeroize the tokens number is that what youre trying to do,1
put pdbtrace before that line and try to print weight from that console,1
remove weight  global weight weight is already a global variable,1
  wait does weight  global weight not give you a syntax error it does for me both in py 2 and in py 3 so i dont think thats their real code,1
  it does there is more than one reason to remove that line,1
op please show us the real code the code that you included has a syntax error and there is no need to include those verbose user instructions,1
i removed the line you guys told me to but now it still tells me that weight isnt defined when i asked the user for it at the beginning of the program i really appreciate the help,1
i updated the original post with the code i currently have along with the functions,1
this programming language claims my is never a good start to a question never  99999999999999 of the time it is correct and it is very unlikely you found a bug in the language,1
please give us the exact error message full traceback not just python is telling me that weight isnt defined,1
please try to make a minimal code which actually shows the error ie i can run it and get the same error you are having it looks like you removed the part which is the actual cause of the problem but you dont know it for example an assignment to weight after the line with error and show the exact exception you are getting,1

lists arent considered string objects but   is so     is concatenating a string to the lists,1
"i get the same error when i remove double quotes as shown below    csrpgprimaryprimaryp  primaryg   primaryain   primaryaout   primarydin   primarydout
primaryg nsup
typeerror cannot concatenate str and list objects
primaryain a
primaryaout b
primarydin sel
primarydout ",1
please edit that into the question,1
what are these interspersed primaryg nsup and what are they supposed to tell us,1
and if that means primaryg is nsup… well then it is a string youre trying to concat with a list,1
those are just output from my print statements,1
"printprimaryp primaryp
    printprimaryg primaryg
    printprimaryain primaryain
    printprimaryaout primaryaout
    printprimarydin primarydin
    printprimarydout primarydout",1
it works if i only concatenate first two lists problem starts from third list onwards csrpgprimaryprimaryp  primaryg  works fine,1
at least one of the things you think is a list is not a list presumably everything that outputs as  instead of ,1
thats the bit im not able to understand i agree with you that first two elements im trying to addprimarypprimaryg dont look like list but more like strings however all six things im trying to add i declared them as lists and for firs two im just appending strings to them for eg primarypappendportname  where portname is a string now my understanding is even though portname is string now it has been added to a primarp list why it is giving an error when im trying to add primaryp to a bigger list csrpgprimary,1
hope i made the question clear code is so big that i dont want to post here and add confusion but my basic question is astringa a bxyzbiglist aappenda now if i do biglistab shouldnt that work,1
the problem is with 99999 certainty that somewhere in your “big code” you’re replacing the list with a string not appending to it,1

num1 is post increment in next line after printf if num1 is used its value will be 2,1
go with printfnum1d num1,1
  this is not the case but imagine a python programmer seing the  operator for the first time that programmer may be a python wizard but that operator doesnt exist in their language,1

look at your errorlog,1
how does using a single word array answer your goal of separating a sentence into words,1
use paper and pencil and calculate what the following expression evaluates to sentencei32  sentencei0 when sentencei is say for example the letter a once you do that you will have the answer to your own question,1
correct indentation is always a plus also be clear about what you mean when you say it does not work also whats 32,1
i indented your code for you see what a nice difference a few whitesapce characters can make for your eyes,1
  one word at a time,1
but the loop runs only until the first space,1
  32 is the ascii code for space,1
  i am using this as a function,1
  you can use it as whatever it still will stop looping at the first space,1
  thanks,1
no youre not youre doing it directly in main,1
by the way since you havent specified how you want these words separated you may as well print the sentence as is it will display the words separated by spaces,1
  it doesnt stop and i cant understand why moreover i am passing an integer by reference which keeps the count of iterations,1
  in my real code,1
  i didnt write it for chinese ,1
  if theres anything not to downvote this question for is chinese characters the question specifically says character arrays ie char chinese characters are wide ie wchart short etc,1
so what have you posted this code for if you want us to refer to your real code then post your real code not something else,1
  they are not most of the world uses utf8httputf8everywhereorg anyway my point is that separating sentence into words based on whitespace is incorrect,1
  whatever thats not char,1
  please post your actual code and please explain as i have already noted to you in one of the comments above how exactly you want to have these words separated because at present you may as well print the sentence as is and the words will come out separated,1
  utf8 is char on lots of systems i can pass chinese into this code on any unix system,1
  well not on all systems and half of the questionsanswers on this website will not work for chinese specifically questions and answers about ascii characters specifically on systems which do not support chinese natively,1
  if its space than compare to   instead of 32 also afaik the character encoding is not guaranteedrequired to be ascii so this code would not be portable with that magic constant,1
the loop will stop when it encounters a character that is equal to both 32 and 0 thats a long wait,1
this is correct,1
is there a question,1
create a new version of a program making a diamond shape and then it gives a picture,1
what logic do you think you should be following,1
how would you step by step map each number to a value firstly figure out what the 10 rows would equal and then see if you see a pattern in how theyre printed per row,1
im just being  lazy i appreciate you guys actually making me do it and somewhat explaining it,1
for problems like these there are more elegant ways to solve them think mathematically what does the shape of absolute value function look like how can you utilize it hint try graphing absx  absy  5 at wolframalpha or some other application that is capable of doing such things,1
this is a opinionbased question and therefore offtopic,1
welcome to stack overflow please read the about and ask pages  note that questions such as this are not suitable for so — they are primarily opinionbased amongst other problems  also tagging with multiple languages is often an indicator of problems with the question  for example you end with c or java — why have you tagged it with c too,1
sockets broken too frequently without knowing the reason is probably going to be an issue no matter the language if you dont find out why,1
you can fix programming errors by finding a better programming language you have to get better at fixing bugs,1
sockets disconnecting doesnt depend on language working with the internet or any network really this can and does happen its your programs job to handle this certain approaches eg rest can make this easier to handle just retry the request again this is not dependend on the language you chose,1
thanks evryone for youre comments that already helps,1
"i know that the broken sockets is generaly not an issue of the programing language itself but getting clear error messages and handling them is the main issue
 for exemple when the connection is timedout i get no error message
i know that java and c are better on this thats why im asking the experienced people for their opinion",1
sorry man but this is a pretty general question to which you could probably easily find the answer yourself just google create a sliding div tutorial and see what pops up,1

may be youre looking for how to enable edit and continue in visual studio,1
  i have done that and still have this problem,1
  edit and continue is enabled,1
are you trying to edit file when the solution is getting built that may be one of the reasons to get this,1
  i edited while in debug mode but i have done this before this time however this error occured how do i solve this problem,1
  do not do that how should the debbuger know that youve edited the file the edits are not compiled and thats why its not working,1
  im new to this and learnt everything myself i made a mistake then how do i solve this problem i searched over the net but did not manage to find a solution,1
this happens because when solution is built a file containing symbolspdb is created this file contains information required to debug and breakpoint related information when you change your source code symbols loaded and corresponding source code is no longer same thats why this error is shown,1
to get rid of this do not edit code while program is running or getting built and if you do edit then just stop current build and build again,1

a rails model is not a table nor any other part of the database while commanding generate model foo creates a corresponding database migration for creating a table for storing instances of foo commanding destroy model foo doesnt destroy the table  as httprailsforumcomviewtopicphppid10961p10961 says beware though  when you generate a model it creates a database migration if you run destroy on that model it will delete the migration file but not the database table ,1

thats what ive said c is a superset of c that means a c code is also a c code but a c code is not always a c code,1
no c is not a strict superset of c just like the link i gave you says,1
thanks for the link i didnt know that not much of a c guy myself community driven qa mailing list etc brings out a primitive being wise syndrome i guess ,1
no c definitely wont always compile as c the first example i can think of is int foo  mallocsizeofint,1
no there are a nontrivial number of legal c programs that are not legal c programs anything involving vlas implicit conversions of void  to other pointer types any code that uses c keywords such as class or new as identifiers etc and that gap gets wider with each new language version  c and c are two completely different languages that share a large subset of syntax but then so do oberon and pascal,1
this perfectly valid c code will never compile with a c compiler typedef int class class new new  mallocsizeof new   ,1

vbx you dont use any signalsslots connection am i missing something,1
  signals and slots are qt specific constructs what vbx gives you here is the standard c solution,1
  i see that but my question is qt specific i thought the notion of signal slot would be a good give away also if you would note i dont ask how to use try catch block,1
  your question is in no way qt specific qt is c it may have special macros and its own special little precompiler and build projects but its still c the fact that you happen to use signals changes nothing about exception handling,1
  the question is very qt specific count will be called asynchronously so knowning where the exception is handled is not as easy as it seems,1
  can you explain that a little generally parameters to a function are fully evaluated before the function is called how does the slot macro make it asynchronous,1
this is a string not a function call slotcount  1slot or maybe 2slot im not sure,1

haskells type classes are not a form of objectorientation they are a form of adhoc polymorphism which you typically also get from object systems but they do not couple data and methods which is the hallmark of objectorientation,1
  they do in fact couple data and methods  the type of the data determines which function or which part of the function definition if you want to view it that way is called,1
that couples the type of the data and methods httpwwwhaskellorghaskellwikioopvstypeclasses,1
  is right haskell typeclasses are much closer to oop interfaces than oop classes but even that analogy isnt perfect in fact the closest thing to oop classes in haskell are simply data types containing functions and monadic actionshttpwwwhaskellorghaskellwikifaqi27mmakinganrpgshouldidefineatypeforeachkindofmonster2candatypeclassforthem3f,1
  yes and that is characteristic of object oriented languages only a minority associate operations with instances at all in even fewer can that be described as the normal operation of the oo system,1
  i dont think this is true although it is an acceptable lie to children  if you dont think about the constraint system typeclasses are just a slightly restricted object system  in that typeclasses have 1 subtyping 2 implicit self reference 3 replaceable self reference aka inheritance  a typeclass is just a parameterized abstract class in oop while an instance is just an object that inherits from that abstract class  with ghc 74 and some trickery involving newtype unsafecoerce and implicit parameters this correspondence becomes complete,1
i also think that couple data and methods is really independent from oo  consider go as the example of a language where methods are separate from structs yet it is very oop,1
on the other hand the naive view that typeclasses are equivalent to interfaces and that datatypes in haskell are equivalent to classes in oop that implement those interfaces is just wrong  the typeclass system is a layer used for defining classes in the mathematical sense aka predicates over haskell types  it just happens to be an object oriented layer to for defining predicates over haskell types,1
  my answer in no way relies on oo being able to do everything that haskell type classes can do it relies on the haskell type class system being able to do everything that oo can,1
  dont know why im responding to this nonsense but typeclasses dont have subtyping dont have implicit self reference and dont have inheritance the haskells overlooked object system paper has a good discussion of why typeclasses dont do the job and hence what it proposes instead and i think the ohaskell paper also motivate the differences quite well anyway implicit parameters are not idiomatic haskell these days and unlikely to make it into a standard and once you start to involve unsafecoerce then youre clearly off the reservation,1
  im not sure what either of those papers have to do with my claim  the class per class encoding is clumsy i agree my point is more subtle  typeclasses in haskell are classes over types  we are all constructivist here so for us to suppose a type is a member of a typeclass requires some sort of evidence object  further the language provides an automatic theorem proving system in the form of inference and global instances  my claim is only that the proof language for this logic is oo and it is helpful for reasoning about haskell to be aware of this fact,1
the evidence type for membership in ord is a subtype of the evidence type for membership in eq  implicit this references and inheritance are what let you declare m  k  m    k in the definition of monad  to simulate this behavior with records requires finding a fixpoint as pointed out by oleg which should clue you in something is up  the reason this shouldnt be surprising is that typeclasses sit on the otherside of the expresion problem from abstract data types  from william cooks work we know that means they are probably objects,1
obviously this object system is a restricted one but you just need to look at bruno oliveiras work to know that is a nonessential aspect see scalas implicits  my point about unsafecoerce is that with some extensions and unsafe features you can actually get your hands on the objects that bare witness to typeclass membership   and using implicit parameters you can construct arbitrary such instances at runtime although it relies on the compiler not obeying its documentation,1
  the evidence type for membership in ord dictionary i suppose you mean isnt a subtype of the evidence type for membership in eq its just that ord membership implies eq membership an ord instance cant override eq methods i have no idea what youre getting at with the monad example  yes if you encode monads with objects then the encoding is objecty but thats because you chose an objecty encoding to begin with anyway this evidence type doesnt always exist other implementations of haskell such as jhc show you can go very far without a dictionary encoding,1
  a proof of membership in ord is a proof of membership in eq  is a is the same thing as subtype  the monad example is about inheritance not subtyping they are separate since unless a monad instance overrides the default definition of  it inherits a general one but this general one uses  which is defined virtually  this is what i was talking about in terms of implicit this parameter and inheritance   the point that you dont have direct access to this object system and that it isnt always implemented directly doesnt really matter  it explains the semantics,1
but you can explain the semantics without an object system too does the fact that i can explain counting with pebbles mean that naturals are a kind of collection of pebbles,1
  an object system is anything that meets certain criteria you cannot say the same of a collection of pebbles,1
that is a good point  i find that thinking about typeclasses as objects plus a prolog like theorem prover where every rule begins with a cute makes it easier to reason about something rather complicated and gives me access to a body of literatures and design principles that apply to my problem  thinking about c templates as a functional language sort of like haskell makes them easier to reason about also  i generally try to understand the weird edges of mathematical systems by describing them in terms of axioms i already know  you dont need ring theory to explain integers,1
i want to send the listint through tcp and ive already get the server and client connected now i need send the listint data from client to server i know the method send is based on char or char i dont know how to deal with listint thank you very much,1
you can turn the list of integers into a single string and parse it out on the other side,1
how many integers do you have it could be good enough to convert int to string snprintf fe and send each one with send,1
i have 25 different values i have to send the value one by one to the server which method should i use to convert it to string,1

  you should change the title of your question to reflect your last comment whats the difference between pip and setuppy isnt much of a question it seems like youre actually interested in something a bit more specific,1
sure thanks a lot,1
  if you want the behaviour of pip use pip,1
thats somewhat misleading though  pip does use setuppy im sure if you get the right options or possibly use a wrapper script its possible to get the same results with setuppy,1
this is incorrect in most cases pip does download the package from pypi unzip it and run the setuppy script albeit with some extra options if you try to have pip install from a tarball for example without a setuppy youll get an error saying so,1
  sure but thats not the question  the question is why the one does not give identical results to the other,1
  obviously theyre not the same program they have different names but your answer fails to highlight the connection one calls the other or explain how to get setuppy to do what the op wants so its technically correct but not useful   has provided what the op was almost certainly looking for,1
  implying that theyre entirely separate when pip calls setuppy is misleading,1
  not really pip probably also uses list but it doesnt follow that they are connected the question does not ask how can i reimplement pip myself,1
  in the context of installing a package pip and setuppy are clearly connected,1
  they may be connected but the question doesnt ask are they connected  it asks why they dont have the exact same behaviour and the answer is because they are not supposed to thats all there is to it how they achieve those effects is not relevant,1
  what other answer is there there is no reason whatsoever to expect them to have the same behaviour you might as well complain that i havent dumped the whole code for pip in my answer,1
  of course you can expect them to have similar behaviour they both serve to install a python package its different behaviour that needs explanation as for another answer  s answer is a good start  providing a single option to setuppy makes it behave like pip thats relevant and likely useful,1
  why does different behaviour need explanation pip does not advertise that it provides identical behaviour nor vice versa in so far as they are supposed to be similar they are similar they install a python package to expect a different explanation is like asking why you and i dont use the same writing style neither of us has indicated that we would,1
  different behaviour requires explanation because the question is about the difference in behaviour where would humanity be if we never asked how or why,1
  almost all code questions could be answered by reading enough source but asking can give more useful information more quickly re different things see redblue example above,1
  the reason why you dont perceive blue and red as exactly the same thing is because they are not exactly the same thing there is no deeper explanation than that if you want to inquire into the mechanisms of perception that is a different question,1
  in both the ops question and my redblue example saying because theyre different does not convey any information that the asker did not already know assuming the question is posed in order to gain information an answer that does not provide information has no value a useful answer to the ops question might discuss how the difference is implemented or why developers chose different mechanisms for the redblue conundrum a useful answer might cover wavelengths of light pigments and colour receptors in the eye,1
  the details of the way that the programmeeye works can be informative and interesting given that the question is asked to gain information if the literal answer to the question contains no information we can infer that we have misunderstood what the asker wants in that case we can attempt to infer the question they meant to ask and provide useful information this process does not always work perfectly but its better than an answer with no information,1
  you may doubt your powers of comprehension but i am confident in my own when someone asks a nonsensical question i assume they dont know that what they are asking is nonsensical rather than inferring that it is an oblique way of soliciting a general disquisition on the topics mentioned in that case informing them that their question is nonsensical is new information,1
  no the question can be clearly understood to have a rational answer more specific than a general discussion possible readings are how can i make them behave in the same way which vartec answered how do they achieve different results similar or why did the developers choose different mechanisms we can presume the pip developers were aware of the other mechanism,1
  leave the votes of others out of it  you are still arguing that i should make up a new question if you want this to be a different question go ahead and edit it,1
  the votes of others became relevant when the discussion moved to what so is about in as much as so is a community what it is about is determined by the opinions of its members,1
  well if you really want to argue about that it turns out that so users dont have to leave a reasoned explanation for their downvotes for example i am getting a bunch of downvotes on old questions which i assume come from you for obvious reasons and vartec whenever he sees my handle he is reminded that i once pointed out an error in one of his answers so no they dont really convey much information,1
  i have not gone back to downvote your other answers and i do not intend to,1
  perhaps vartec is feeling extra insecure today,1
  no its not an ad hominem look it up otoh your comment is a childish attempt to provide an excuse to withdraw from the discussion,1
i will downvote any answer that is clearly wrong   if you can name any of your correct answers that ive allegedly downvoted dont be shy mention it,1
  you know that i cant tell who is downvoting my answers especially as you never leave comments one presumes that is because you have no valid criticisms,1
  he means his great answers like httpstackoverflowcomquestions10129080analysisanddesignforfunctionalprogramming1012917210129172,1
  i note that you havent left a comment on that i defy you to locate any inaccuracies in that answer,1
im not going to try to arbitrate on other answers withdrawing from the discussion on the other hand sounds like an excellent idea   good luck trying to argue the case for this answer,1
  theres no case to be argued you have spent several hours complaining that i have provided an answer to the question asked not to your preferred question you could complain about every other question on so on that basis,1
  any fyi your revenge downvotes will get revoked,1
  just because you string some words together it doesnt follow that they make sense youre the one whose fragile ego has lead you to engage in a campaign of downvoting my answers willynilly,1
  unlikely its good to know that you dont understand the downvotereversing system,1
i really appreciate your work and comments on this thread actually those comments run beyond my expectation i might need to recheck my question statements for clarity or i should fire another question then,1
how do i do that in c,1
this is the formula for the euclidian distance it doesnt apply to the earth since its not a linear the latlong space is not a plane,1
you dont have xyz you have latitude and longitude a coordinate system where one of the coordinates is not parallel on a spherical surphace to boot neither of your formulas works,1
   i know how to do all of them didnt quite understand it being in that form,1
  first the earth is kind of spherical second the parallels are curved on the spherical surface because they are not the shortest line between two points the definition of straight the meridians are a useful formula has to take this into account the first formula above can be a useful approximation when the distance isnt too big,1
it would be nice to have a library that can just even suggest for the review,1
what does this answer mean of course it is possible to check the text of python code for duplication just like any other language,1
  i know that you can check it however the op is asking for a library to check it for him atleast thats what i think hes trying to ask,1
  there is no reason why you couldnt create such a tool for python they exist for other languages,1
i believe the answer means youd have to roll your own duplicate code checker solution someone else probably hasnt done that yet,1
  i know you can make your own but op is asking if there is one already made,1
  your answer strongly suggests that it is impossible there is no way to really distinguish whether it has repeated or not,1
  ok i will edit it now ,1

  you have a perfect username for this site but i like to give people the benefit of the doubt,1
  well unfortunately i have way too much experience in both php and answering questions so it leave no place for doubts ,1
  thats known problem with this site most answers just triggered by the keywords in the question or even just question title people seldom trying to get the meaning of the question but rather tend to directly answer to some keywords it is fastest gun in the west problem partially to blame for this and whole stackoverflow paradigm which encourage votes not real help,1
how would the compiler know if a public field of a public class is used it could be used in an assembly thats not a part of the current build,1
seconding that i do not believe the issue is what you describe inlines the values the compiler would only do that for const  otherwise ldfld is used and the jit is not going to worry overly about is this assigned elsewhere the only things that might affect this are obfuscators and full linkers like aot in mono incidentally properties would be far preferable to fields here imo,1
also methodimplmethodimploptionsnoinlining is not valid on fields so i doubt that is your real code,1
i have added more behavior comment in the code sample i dont know why or how the compilerjitter makes assumptions all i see is what the debugger shows me and that is no matter if the value is true or false it will simply not perform the true part of the if no matter value in optssilent if optimizations are enabled but will behave correctly if i disable them,1
  you are correct the statement does not work or even compile for that matter i had pasted in there to mention that i have tried this avenue without success but i forgot to remove it when i pasted the code here ill remove it,1
please post optsparse,1
what the hell is volatile doing there like eric lippert said if you are using volatile you are probably using it wrong,1
well i could post parse and all methods that go with it but that would be rather voluminous and it is not the problem parse works fine the values a read fine the debugger sees the good values its just that although after parsing optssilent is trueconfirmed by debugger and watch the code behave as if it is still false and the same goes for the other variables well this is no longer the behavior since i mark them as volatile but it is when i remove it everything would be fine if it would also be allowed on doubles,1
  volatile instructs the compiler to make no assumptions on the content of the variable as it might be changed by another thread at anytime thus disabling some optimizations on it,1
  and there is your mistake i bet you only have a single thread running making this assumption pointless  unless for some absurd reason you have parse running as a thread,1
  everything would be fine wait your claim is that this doesnt work even for the bool one no your sample is for the bool one so what is failing the bool or the double,1
but to emphasise i dont know why or how the compilerjitter makes assumptions  simple it doesnt,1
im pretty sure that volatile didnt fix your problem but just masked it you clearly do something horribly wrong in optsparse but without the relevant code we cant tell you what,1

what is the difference between powered on and rebooted,1
it starts at zero at a full boot not at a restore from sleep or hibernation  not caring about this is important not in the least because this behavior isnt promised anywhere,1
  if you dont want to answer then dont obviously theres a difference in my case,1
gettickcount can roll over dont use it for longrunning events and being rude to people trying to help you guarantees no one will answer your question,1
i think sarnold was asking for a reasonable clarification not least because a reboot does powercycle the machine making it unclear what you might have expected the difference to be,1
   sarnolds question is extremely pertinent the fact that you dont recognize it as such does not warrant rudeness especially if you expect anyone to help you after observing your attitude ill rephrase his question for you what is your perceived difference between powered on and rebooted,1
  passant so youre saying its a reboot right not a shutdown,1
thats a nonsensical distinction whats the difference between a shutdown followed by a poweron vs a reboot,1
  its important here not to be rude to people youre asking for free help  asking for more information or clarification isnt not wanting to answer please try and be polite and there is absolutely no difference between a shutdown and a reboot a reboot is a shutdown with a restart to the os the difference is only meaningful to the bios and hardware,1
the problem is that nobody has yet figured out what the value is while the machine is shut down,1
you dont power on an os  you power on a physical piece of hardware  anyway it should be pretty trivial to test whether gettickcount returns a value indicating when windows was started and when the hardware was powered on,1
the difference between a machine having been shutdown vs rebooted is that a shutdown can be followed by a poweroff when reboot does not still why does it matter what i need this for obviously i do otherwise id not ask it here is it also worth going into all this polemic vs simply answering the question and to sarnolds question  my answer was to the way he worded it when i read it,1
a shutdown can be followed by a poweroff huh how can a shutdown not be followed by a poweroff when reboot does not according to whom still why does it matter what i need this for it doesnt  nobody asked that to begin with is it also worth going into all this polemic vs simply answering the question yes because your question is nonsensical and we need to make sense of it in order to answer it come back when you learn how to ask a proper question or at least learn how to not be rude to people trying to help you,1
  what is not clear in my question you reboot computer and it simply reloads os  the power is not turned off when someone shuts it down the power can be switched off or computer can be powered off i want to know if rebooting a computer resets the tick counter how else do you want me to word it to skip all this bs,1
you reboot computer and it simply reloads os  the power is not turned off according to whom why do you think this were back to your perceptions here which you have yet to adequately explain,1
i hope my edit clarifies things,1
   until someone describes the perceived difference to the os between rebooting and restarting and shutting down then powering on i doubt it,1
httpenwikipediaorgwikirebootingcomputingsoftreboot,1
and btw i am pretty sure this can be empirically tested,1
   again regarding soft reboots what is the difference to the os which is whats being queried here,1
  based on the answer below nothing,1
   exactly my point ,1
too little information to answer this  ask a specific question and provide us with detailed information about your setup,1
i dont want to use any ready made libraries i want to create a calender from scratch  i am not able to understand how to get the dates into their respective slots in a calendar table,1
it sounds like youd be best using a for loop,1
what is the code you have written to achieve this ,1
can u write the code here ,1
no its not possible to do that in php,1
wait wut it doesnt loop through 10000000 but just 10000000 i dont get it,1
as far as i can tell that returns one address not two,1
show us the tables structure  output of the query,1
you should do some basic sql tutorial it will help you a lot more than asking here,1
in particular you should learn the join syntax  the querybas originally written used the classic syntax join is the modern syntax,1
because that isnt valid c syntax,1
its not valid anything syntax,1
i would start on fixing error 1 not 28,1
are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference,1
thats not a question thats just an error message is the question that you dont understant the error message,1
"sqlcommand command  new sqlcommand query connection

quicksort is great because you can actually test the parts separately  you can try testing the partition function to see if it works then test the recursive quicksort separately  also note that your definition of random might crash if num  1,1
what do you mean increase it i cant increase it if it goes out of bounds,1
that last swap pos i looks suspicious i assume its supposed to move the pivot value to its final destination but after the partition loop the value at pos probably isnt the pivot any longer,1

alright ive done that juan,1
do you have a specific question,1
well im not looking for an instant walktrough answer i just want some help i have just sat there coding for 2 days trying to figure it out if you understand what i mean,1
what happens what works what doesnt work we just went through this exercisehttpstackoverflowcomquestions11145075methodnewbieidontknowhowtodebugit  also i find it difficult to read the code without indentation and excess comments but others may have different opinions regarding that,1
it might also help if you mention which sorting algorithm youre trying to implement what youre using as a reference implementation if anything etc because even with the comments its not clear how youre trying to implement the actual sort,1
whats  supposed to be a lessthan ,1
 i thought youd figure it out anyway if the first element in the array if bigger than the second then the current smallestnumber variable numsmall then im gonna do that in the loop and put the numsmall in the sorted array as i go i guess thats a bad algorithm but it is still a wip,1
am i missing the 2nd part of that,1
 ethis yes it would appear you are and now youre adding  variables in a methodthrowing random syntactical elements at a problem is only going to make things worse consider looking at something like thishttpphilcrissmancom20100718hownottowritesortingalgorithmsinruby or thishttpeigenclassblogspotcom200810sortingalgsinrubyhtml as a place to start writing sortsright now youre kind of flailing at both coding and asking questions that will be responded to,1
 ethis also take the time to indent your code properly trim unnecessary elements eg useless whitespace etc if you need to describe what the code is supposed to put a comment at the beginning of a blocknot after every single line name variables so its obvious what they aredont make us think any more than we need to consider reading esrs how to ask questions the smart wayhttpwwwcatborgesrfaqssmartquestionshtml thoroughly revisit the so faq i linked to yesterday etc,1
you havent explained what the exception is,1
what exception are you getting are you sure the actual connection string is correct the correct server the correct login credentials,1
as a programming side note use the using statement to scope your expensive resources,1
i put this as comment because i cant think that this is related to your problem the syntax for addwithvalue is addwithvaluestring paramname object paramvalue what are you doing is add a parameter named   with value sqldbtypeint then the return value is a sqlparameter and you add the correct value but on the string fullname this wreak havoc,1
i get this exceptiona networkrelated or instancespecific error occurred while establishing a connection to sql server the server was not found or was not accessible verify that the instance name is correct and that sql server is configured to allow remote connections provider named pipes provider error 40  could not open a connection to sql server,1

if you have to be like the results should be sequential youre doing it wrong  threading and sequential dont go together very well threads run pretty much when they feel like it  consider it the price of being able to do two things at once  you give up some control over exactly in what order they get done  if you want stuff to run in a particular order youll have to do some synchronization read making threads block just to get what sequential processing gives you for free,1
any example we can check or be more specific about error,1
youre going to have to describe exactly what doesnt work means errors in the console errors in layout,1
make a jsfiddle showing your code failing so we can test against it,1
you could just write var rowcount  inputcheckboxnamecheckedlength,1

x is scoped to the function assigned to a that last alert never  actually appears  you get a syntaxerror because x is not defined,1
there is no way you will get 13 you will get x is not defined because x is scoped inside a maybe you have set x  13 somewhere in the global scope also,1
httpjsfiddlenetmybkt as   said,1
there is no possible way that that alerts 13,1
if youre testing your code in a developer console you need to be sure to refresh the page to clear any previously set x globals,1
  please check httpjsfiddlenethj4vk6,1
   the fiddle you are linking to is not alerting 13 it alerts 10 because you are alerting the value of aa inside the function assigned to c,1
  your fiddle shows the last alert as undefined whats the trouble ,1
done no 13 which in the case of that fiddle is even less surprising than for the code you posted as the fiddle lacks the last alert call,1
hi all i am agreeing my mistake i misunderstood,1
what might have been the case is that you forgot the var in front of the x which makes it a member of the global object  in this case the last alert would give you 13 however the alerttypeof x would give you number then,1

no you cant do that with a website you may i dont know for sure be able to do what you need with an application however you dont necessarily need to prevent them copying text from another application you may be able to get away with only preventing them from pasting to your application,1
i know it is usurpi want to create a xx thing which will allow user to solve some question but should not copy answers from their hard driveis it possible to do anthing close to itor any other way to do so,1
  the thing is user can just read text from notepad and just type in my appi dont want that,1
  perhaps you could instead warn the user that they should not leave your application during the question then detect if they do and treat the transgression appropriately,1
what if the user has another computer handy,1
  all caps is typically read as shouting  you should perhaps be mindful of how you appear to others reading the site who have no reason or requirement to help you,1
  they could also easily take answers from a piece of paper  how will you stop that,1
 hey sorry,1
  see copying from a piece of paper is old and classic way it can not be stoped unless you keep a supervisorso consider a supervisor in the room with students,1
if you have a supervisor in the room they can also watch for students using other applications  windows is explicitly designed so that you cannot stop people getting to the task manager  that said i guess that a custom windows shell might be able to override this im not sure  but now youre getting into rewriting windows explorer,1
   no there can be a supervisor for that,1
   no supervisor wont be able to look at everyones computer and students have their own laptops and students are more smart than supervisorthis is the condition here in indiabad luck,1
   there has to be some waymay be not possible with an app but may be possible with something elsei dont know,1

definitely not working with 517 7534572 with the p3p headers,1

now i get it   is right lings cars who use outrageous sales techniques would like the site  it was an educational work and with the mouse over events currently turned on it is amusing but busy and annoying  despite appearances nothing is for sale on the site except maybe a used car,1
  i will do that jspref  although the question is important i have to convert my script to object literal notation anyway  when that is eventually done ill put it on the site and place a link here,1
" t i only half answered your request for clarification   
proper objects  objects created using object literal notation  all use of the word object refers to that as opposed to a regular object under javascript",1
  i have no idea why you have this requirement there is no distinction between objects initialised with object literal notation and objects built up in some other fashion beyond syntax at the point of initialisation absolutely none at all its like asking how to convert a car to a proper car where proper car means the car was built in japan rather than korea its meaningless,1
 t the requirement is mainly educational  i guess it boils down to this  i currently am not wrapping my functions within objects but that would change if i use that style  if i understand your answer object literal notation is an issue of style and will have the exact same performance as other javascript objects that contain functions  i should research performance issues in javascript relating to dereferencing where objects are concerned  i think,1
  yes more or less whether you created an object with object literal notation or not has no bearing whatsoever on the object itself  its just an initialisation syntax,1
you should read objectivec tutorials its not that easy as you think the main diference is when declaring methods in objectivec static ones are declared with a preceding  and instance method with a  also the syntax is way too different you wont get it just seeing examples,1
i think if anyone manages to answer this most of the people new to objectivec will understand it much better,1
yes transform buggy java code to objectivec i recommend to start from learning basics of both languages,1
marek java is a bit easier to understand thats why im doing prototypes of my apps in java also i know more than basic of objectivec as i have my app on the appstore but i never used return methods by now when i need them,1
on a side note ifcard  randomcard will not work in java you should use the equals method to compare strings,1
klara i changed my question for all of you to understand easier what i want also i found out myself how to do the calling methods and return nsstring method also  works in java but equals is better ,1
objective c is no different or harder to use than java the syntax is just different or not what youre used to,1
as an aside card  randomcard will work sometimes in java but its comparing to see if the references are the same not whether the string contents are the same some java implementations will intern some strings so sometimes that line of code will work objectivec exhibits similar properties,1
actually in objectivec the  syntax compares memory locations of pointers so this will never work,1
it will only work sometimes when you declare a literal nsstring some text you are assigning a memory space and if you use that some text again it will be the same nsstring used before the same memory address thats done automatically by the compiler because nsstrings are immutable and it will be safe to do it thats why if you do some text  some text it will return yes,1

this or similar solution is acceptable in some cases for example if you have regex or wildcard servername such as servername mydomaincomnetorg you probably dont want to have code duplication with other server blocks so you may use something like if host  www  do redirect  btw this if is not in location context ,1

php sessions are not stored in ram but as files on the disk and who told you they are lost when the webserver is restarted,1
   i didnt realize php sessions were stored on disk that said my point on durability stands if the server crashes as opposed to restarts you lose your session data with redis or mysql backed sessions you have better durability,1
even then you dont necessarily lose them unless the os crashes and the session file is damaged or wasnt actually written to the harddisk yet,1
i would also think that if redis is installed on the same machine as phpthe webserver then it would not count as reading over the network,1
given that php native sessions are stored on disk the point of security is no longer valid,1
 is just a language function like concatenation or multiline strings using external resources like an extra file thats not included in the quine is plain cheating,1
actually import is just a language function like concatenation or multiline strings  using external ressources like using include stdioh in c or linking the standard library is perfectly valid in quines else there would be no quines in compiled languages  however there is a good cause why not to allow too advanced high level functions in a language like languages allowing introspection and there are introspection modules for python readily available  hence what i wrote  the consequence from outlawing import is to outlaw  too  sorry folks,1
do you outlaw s in c quines too,1
i definitively call it cheating  printf is a high level library function not a basic language construct  if you implement something like printf in your quine that is ok  but abstain from higher level library functions only use basic io please,1
adding one thing  the only thing where the use of the printf function could be acceptable in c quines is for the exact usage printfss in situations where printfs might abuse the formatting function of printf  compare fprintfosfos saves 1 byte compared to ffputsostdoutfso  i would call this the only possibly legitimate use of printf or s in c quines  there might be similar uses of  in python but i dont think those constructs are shorter than the direct output,1
as far as i am aware the purpose of a quine is to write a program that outputs its own source without external inputs  does not use an external source import can be viewed in two ways either you consider the second file an external source thus breaking the rules or you consider the imported code as part of the source in which case your quine does not print out the full source thus  does not violate quine rules and your import does,1
  touch nixpy python nixpy  cmp nixpy   however nixpy the empty file is no quine  read with quines its simply is not that simple as you probably think  also import does not use external sources as this is compile time not runtime,1
  you outlawed import statements herequestions6223285comment3054141018831770,1
έρικκωνσταντόπουλος if you agree to my statement there you also agree that  is cheating  as my argument is   is cheating iff import is cheating  this means either we allow both or none  and again i repeat import is not accessing external resources like include stdioh isnt cheating and linking in standard c libraries isnt too  only using too high level functions is cheating  and my argument is that import is even a lower level construct than   so using any is cheating  btw  why am i downvoted while httpstackoverflowcoma18521084 is upvoted,1
  please cool down a bit r is just 2 characters of the string the operator  that uses them is just an operator not an external thing the repr builtin is also a builtin not a highlevel function,1
έρικκωνσταντόπουλος thanks for noting this  until now i focused entirely on print  being something like printfa a which usually is considered cheating in c quines  i fully oversaw this r which is even worse  it uses repr which is language introspection  do you really think language introspection shall be allowed in quines,1
  i cant seem to understand you i guess also why shouldnt it be allowed its just that you cant read input and you cant have an empty program,1
έρικκωνσταντόπουλος sorry i meant reflectionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikireflectioncomputerprogramming  reflection allows a program to look at its own source code  this commonly is considered cheating in quineshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiquinecomputing22cheating22quines  please note that we are at 13 comments for 13 downvotes now  so i thank you very much to reach the recommendation for a comment per downvotehttpmetastackexchangecoma2373 without need for spam  ill now stop commenting until the need for comments arises again  merry xmas,1
ppcg has a good definition of quineshttpscodegolfmetastackexchangecomquestions4877whatcountsasaproperquinerepr does not use reflection it is a standard function that takes string inputs and outputs other strings an example would be does reprinput read the source at all the string just happens to include part of the source as the source defines the string as what else would when hardcoding a string and  on a string is just string formatting formatting is also a function that doesnt rely on the source just the arguments ie no side effects,1

nobody is saying that all objects should be on the stack were discussing why the default stack size is small,1
its is not small  just how many function calls would you have to get through to use up 1mb of stack  the defaults are anyway easily changed in the linker and so we are left with why use stack instead of heap,1
one function call  int main  char buffer1048576   its a very common newbie problem  sure theres an easy workaround but why should we have to workaround the stack size,1
well for one thing i woudnt want the 12mb or indeed 1mb of stack requirement inflicted on the stack of every thread that calls the afflicted function  that said i have to agree that 1mb is a little stingy  i would be happy with a default 100mb after all theres nothing stopping me turning it down to 128k in just the same way as theres nothing stopping other developers turning it up,1
why wouldnt you want to inflict 12mb of stack on your thread  the only reason for that is because stacks are small  thats a recursive argument,1
stacks are not small  128k max size works just fine on my apps  thats getting towards small 1mb is far too much for most apps but well only matters with apps that run 2k threads  i have never felt the slightest inkling to allocate even 100k of stack space for anything  anyway i answered the op question  i know of no technical reason to limit stack space to 1mb  its not even a firm limit  its perapp configurable,1

i think youve got a dangling  in your first printf there,1
sorry that was a mistake it still prints out one though,1
if im not wrong the second have to print 1 because is 3  7  5 which is true and so 1 because 3  7  3 which is less than 5,1
   has higher precedence than  so its 3  4  3  5,1

at least timer please,1
you do not have timer in console and its answers the question on hand,1
of course you have timer in console you just need to reference the appropriate libraries thread sleeping sucks and you will drain your processor with while loops like this,1

please read httpstackoverflowcomhelpdontask,1
the problem is program freezing hence no error message i think i suggest you to check the while true part first ps shall we just focus on the questions not the rules,1
  on the debugger its just fine then only after that i posted here i had no clue what was causing it i will check the while loop,1
  thanks for that but its not the while loop im not able to trace it,1
as stated elsewhere while true is pretty horrible but its especially bad news on the windows message loop thread which probably explains why your console app appeared to work your windows application cannot continue to process ui events as youve tied up the message loop forever,1

razor does not encourage combining code with markup any more than any other view engine if youre under that impression youre probably misinformed the core concept in aspnet mvc is that if you want to extend the view with codebased logic you write an htmlhelper extension in a separate class file,1
every sample ive seen of it incorporates code into the view  big nono should never have been allowed this is such a contentious issue that we are sure to get some lively debate ,1
  i have very good knowledge of mvvm silverlight and wpf  when switching to web i assumed mvc was the closest correlation  if you dont suggest mvc aspnet mvc or razor what do you suggest,1
i suggest aspnet mvc with the regular parser,1
so you recommend insertion of code snippets in markup honest question because i do not have personal experience,1
  was your comment to me or to irishcieftain  im only now just going through the samples  i havent made up my mind im just wondering if this code base is dead in two years or where it is going,1
my comment was   razor does not endorse code in the view any more than spark or the original asp view engine does in fact razor is an attempt to clean up the view markup irishchieftans malice toward razor is unfounded as is his endorsement of the original asp engine,1
just because it doesnt endorse it doesnt mean lots of people arent doing it take one look at the online samples these days i suggest we address our opinions to the original op since you cant come up with a solid reason to use it in the first place microsoft brought out razor for a specific reason and it wasnt to clean up the markup,1
  hasnt the same always been said of css and javascript though best practices abound about separating markup from everything else its up to the coder to follow them you cant blame the tool for the coders bad decisions,1
  you have a point but would i still want to use it for the sake of saving a few key strokes or am i missing something,1
  your argument that every razor sample youve seen incorporates code into the view is erroneous if you see business logic in a view thats the fault of the developer not the view engine all tools can be abused when razor is used correctly the resultant code is far quicker to write and vastly more readable in comparison to the equivalent    blocks having used both extensively i can report there is no reason for using the original asp view engine any more  its inferior period,1
its an open invitation for young devs to do it wrong and the payoff it provides just dont justify it for me a case of to each his own ,1
1 a fool with a tool is still a fool equating bad implementation decisions by developers to the usefulness of a development technology doesnt make any sense,1
razor is a stupid decision by ms and brings us back 20 years in web development fell free to downvote me,1

it looks like you want us to write some code for you while many users are willing to produce code for a coder in distress they usually only help when the poster has already tried to solve the problem on their own a good way to demonstrate this effort is to include the code youve written so far example input if there is any the expected output and the output you actually get console output tracebacks etc the more detail you provide the more answers you are likely to receive check the faq and ask,0

hahah  i have problem what is answer,0
please consider searching the stackoverflow threads and other mediums before posting a question additionally make sure you post a question showing what you have tried,0
you mean like google,0
what do you want to know you have a method signature and an example call there is nothing more to be said about the code you posted,0
why am i garnering minuses on my question is it because people dont know the answer and want to take it out on the asker,0
codeinchaos how would you use this how is it useful how is it a method signature im used to seeing like public int testint a string b if it were like that it would make more sense,0
  and boltclock yes it is c if i put it into a solution it doesnt yell at me and even provides intellisense for the test method if indeed that is what it is as for compiling it nothing seems to happen it doesnt yell at me at the very least,0
that doesnt look like real sourcecode i cant think of a context where these two lines would compile if you claim that it compiles please post a compilable sample its just the method signature with an omitted body since documentation usually doesnt contain the method body,0
is this the full code sample,0
please post the link to the original doxygen example,0
not even the version you posted now compiles you cant have a method with no body inside a class,0
i ran it in vs2010 runs and compiles but does nothing,0
  doesnt compile for me,0
is this homework if not this is a remarkably bad method to do this operation,0
also if working fine means that the binary equivalent of 0xff is 1515 somethings wrong with my math skills,0

how are you applying the expression please post your code also please clarify what you mean with but none of them seemed to work what exactly does not work what is the result you get d only matches a single digit 09 matches the whole string if it contains at least on digit it appears you want d,0
wellstay cool  jcrowder sorry if im not as good as you i failed  ok can i,0
this question should probably have the homework tag,0
  and all that vote down thank you for your down votes now i cant ask more questionsi dont understand why you think this question will not help future visitors i tryed to find the answer to my problem and couldnt find any so here it is if someone have the same problem in the future here is the answer the knowledge is so vast that no one knows everything and sometimes its the little things we do not know that make all the difference,0
formatting your code and data sure makes a difference we put effort into our answers for you please put some effort into your questions for us,0
please have a look at the faqhttpstackoverflowcomfaq on how to ask a good question and also maybe read this what have you triedhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
yes there is a way but youll need to show your actual html and javascript that youre trying to do this with were not going to write it for you,0
can you show us how did you assign the id to your tag,0
this question shows a huge lack of effort both in researching and phrasing without actual code,0
you have to be more specific how do you want to send it do you have an established connection with the server what protocol can it be socet or has to webservice,0
i hope you arent making something sneaky  like a virus,0

what fiddle where exactly is the problem,0
still looking for possible description or even solution to this cause i do need that clean file hierarchy by pip but with setuppy way,0
  in what way is this incorrect just because pip expects a setuppy it does not mean that pip does not provide any other behaviour,0
dude you answer is just plain wrong and downvoting my answer wont change that,0
  how is my answer wrong the reason op does not get exactly the same behaviour from setuppy as from pip is because they are not the same programme nor are they supposed to be whether or not he could use some combination of switches to achieve that is irrelevant,0
  are you trolling,0
  are you im answering the question that was asked,0
  that still does not make my answer misleading as you so charmingly put it,0
  by strict literalism yes you have correctly answered the question but the details are relevant its pretty clear that the op wants some understanding of why they behave differently or a way to modify the behaviour of one its like answering why do i perceive red differently from blue with because theyre different colours correct but useless,0
  where would we be if we constantly asked trivial questions different things are different if op wants to know about the implementation he is free to look at the source,0
  youre trolling arent you,0
  certainly not are you trolling you are the one who is defending a question that amounts to why are two distinct things not the same,0
  in neither case does the mechanism answer the why question it amounts to a restatement of the fact that the programmeeye works in a particular way you are essentially complaining that i didnt make up a question that like more and choose to answer that,0
  the very fact that you identify three possible topics shows that all that can be provided is general information of some kind so is not about making up your own better question and answering it,0
  so is not about providing unhelpful overlyliteral answers to provide useful information we often have to infer a better question the vote counts on these answers suggest other users think that providing some useful information is better than a literal but unhelpful answer,0

people will only put effort into responses if you put effort into your question requests to write code your code will probably be ignored requests for help in a specific area or a specific sample would have a better chance of response,0
  considering his rep i think he just has not had his morning coffee yet,0
  oh dont judge people by their rep considering the code he have not a slightest idea what does his code do,0
this question isnt particularly well phrased  it took the comments on the answers to actually work out whats really being asked,0
i strongly suspect youve misdiagnosed the issue please show a short but complete program demonstrating the problem,0
your code the one you haven’t posted is almost comically wrong this is why it’s important that you post all the relevant code questions like this just waste everybody’s time,0
  i wonder how you can judge that is comical if you havent seen it if you dont know the answer to the question how to prevent optimization on a class field in c please feel free to not waste your time with it,0
what have you tried so farhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
facepalm its help with the code im asking for i have not written any code yet with this omg,0
very basic stuff 1 second google httpphpnetmanualenreservedvariablespostphp,0
what exactly are you asking,0
  then next time dont tag java,0
did you just list every language you know,0
if you want a generic solution theres an language agnostic tag you should be using,0
not just code explain what youre trying to do in code next the problem,0
i dont know what you are doing with your edits here you have added a huge block of code and other information twice once before it got reopened and then you removed it and added it back recently,0
   see the discussion here httpmetastackexchangecomquestions189591issosprogrammerssiteabetterplaceforadvancedquestions189595189595,0
what doesnt work what error do you get what have you done to troubleshoot this,0
this makes no sensereturns a constant if you initialize the variables and doesnt even compile because you use uninitialized variables,0
if the guy types in haha lol xd  then you should probably beat the crap out of him,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is toolocalised,0
did you try looking for loop javascrip or javascript interval  do it,0
come one whats the code youve attempted,0
good luck getting one  i would expect these to be totally identical,0
a logical explanation of what exactly why theyre nearly identical because theyre essentially the same comparison,0
this is horrible advice  and only artificially extends how many more fragments you can pack in  this problem still remains google explicitly states not to use this to address memory leaks,0
completely incorrect answer,0
yeah this doesnt work produces an exact duplicate of the gif,0
ive never seen a 23 answer before err sorry 24,0
unlucky the guys answer got accepted because that pins the answer up you often only see a few because they sink to the bottom pretty quickly so nobody pays attention to it ,0
whenever you learn a new language the first thing you should read are the operators read the reference before posting,0
very basic question that smells like homework,0
   you need to understand how to accomplish it someone else doing it wont help i really suggest pp  paper pencil,0
did you forget to have coffee today,0
please provide what you have tried so far,0
 is an unary operator socalled not do googling about c operators unarybitwise ones,0
yea wwwgooglecom,0
do some research before posting quest here,0
what help do you want and what have you tried,0
so what have you tried,0
and you want we create your code,0
no effort shown  no database mentioned,0
you could have easily got the answer by a simple google search  check this  httpwwww3schoolscomsqlsqltopasp,0
questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved include attempted solutions why they didnt work and the expected results,0
is that a question,0
lucky im not a compiler,0
you dont need to write the type down but if you cant figure it out on your own that just means you dont actually know what your program does,0
this code does not do any validation,0
thats the answer i gave 3 hours ago when you asked,0
still shouldnt be used at it looks horrible and devs maintaining your markup in the future will think its okay to reuse if youve used it  and they may not style out its inherent ugliness in practice its to be avoided,0
personally id avoid the thickness as it looks chunky,0
upvote means this question shows research effort it is useful and clear and at least 5 people on stackoverflow think this question meets that criteria,0
wait what you want me to help you steal a bunch of usernames and passwords,0
this isnt a place to have your script written for you search for perl open on how to open and read your file youll probably need some regexes to figure out whats a heading and whats a variable,0
why on earth are you doing three different queries to get data from your members table  youre selecting a field you already have in the first query some not necessarily related users encrypted password in the next query and then youre selecting every single userid in your members table,0
  its not really just a php thing its a working with relational databases thing and sort of a basic logic thing too  write out what you want your code to do verify that it makes sense and youre not adding a bunch of extra steps then write the actual code,0
what did you try,0
how is this parallel at all thats totally sequential i dont know why op accepted this as an answer,0
i dont see any question neither any description of what youve tried so far voting to close the question as not a real question,0
so is not your blog what does it mean to learn jquery before javascript that makes no sense,0
non sequitur  thanks,0
i think jquery is far more than just a javascript library no its just a library,0
we aint doing your homework for you show us your code explain what problem youre encountering and then we can help you,0
this answer doesnt absolutely reflect the point of question the asker wants no view controller,0
  i believe i already did globals are bad and what you have in your code are fancy globals i suggest you watch the videos in tereskos answer,0
just in case anyone reading this answer in the future thinks it is correct it is not mattmcdonalds answer is leaps and bounds better than this also never listen to w3schools they do not know what they are talking about and will misguide you,0
there are c to vbnet converters on the internet that can give you a big head start on a lot of this stuff,0
ok so youve told us the query and that you need help  neither of those things are questions whats the question what part are you having trouble with,0
welcome to so what have you tried please show you nonworking code and specify what is the current output and what is your desired output,0
have you considered hiring and paying a programmer,0
i am speechless,0
  google translate formats english in humanreadable format the grammar spacing is generally correct and it capitalises recognised nouns and the first word in a sentence the op may have used it to aid in his translations but he certainly didnt post its raw output,0
"from httpstackoverflowcomquestionshowtoask 

do your homework

have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question sharing your research helps everyone tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs this demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself it saves us from reiterating obvious answers and most of all it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer
be specific

if you ask a vague question you’ll get a vague answer but if you give us details and context we can provide a useful answer",0
need more information what are the values of your variables have you turned on errorreporting what error if any is being displayed repeating the title of the question in the actual question itself does not help to answer any of these items,0
we need more information seriously what do you expect us to do gaia,0
why should that code even work you never call your register function sometimes it work  bet that never works if that is the complete code,0
youll learn a lot more if you do your own homework id suggest starting by paying attention to formattingindentation,0
maybe contact this person httpstackoverflowcomquestions6806568errorcelsiuscannotberesolvedtoavariablerq1 who is doing the same homework question,0
why are you using a loop inside your methods makes no sense and why are you declaring scanner inside your method,0
it is a nonsense index is ever belong to order,0
google is your friend,0
this is totally unreliable,0
what effort have you made to research this question yourself,0
  you should take a basic tutorial or text book on tagc before asking here ,0
i am willing to sacrifice my 300 points just to downvote you even more,0
did you do any research before posting does asnumeric not work,0
this is homework used in coursera course programming in r it should be deleted from the page,0
we are not going to debug your 1000 line code dump,0
  screenscraping is generally frowned upon so is making bots combine the two and you have a recipe for downvotes sans an explanation one has to conclude youre making a bot to game the game,0
  then too hes basically asking for someone else to write code for him,0
if you have questions like this then start reading a quickstarter cc tutorial before trying to solve any kind of problems,0
hope the 2 upvotes are for the sake of the joke,0
please read a better c tutorial you seem to be missing the absolute basics of this language,0
i love his thinking  made my day,0
i just threw up a little in my mouth,0
sorry but 1 for zero effort,0
this is not a freelancers portal but qa site so read how to ask question etc herehttpsstackoverflowcomtour,0
i want a spaceship but seriously this question is lacking effort and understanding where is your code what have you tried,0
no detail on what you want to achieve no clear direction you havent even tried to ask the right question,0
probably because your question is short shows no demonstration of effort and seems to purposely discount the usual solutions that might be the best or only possibilities,0
probably because your question is way too broad and you have not posted the code you currently have so is not a do my homework site,0
in all seriousness just google search for css starfield and see what you get,0
did you study about time complexity calculation before asking the question,0
please perform rudimentary research on questions before posting to stackoverflow this question could be answered immediately using google,0
possible startingpoint any c tutorial book standard or the like,0
just try something on your own before asking from another this is a lazy post,0
  lazy like shortcircuit evaluation,0
everything on the computer in any form is indeed real and stores somewhere this is more of a hardware question if you want those details not programming so i wouldnt ask on stackoverflow,0
dollar off ,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is about philosophy,0
im guessing part of the reason people downvoted is because of the phrase if you have a 64bit program installed on a 32bit computerlaptop which of course is so obviously impossible that its nonsensical,0
thats ridiculous,0
1 for not doing your assignment and get some other people do it for you,0
atleast provide some basics done by you and a hint that this is an assignment,0
haha this made my day o,0
hahahahhahaha this made me laugh for the first time today d,0
  regardless of whether the code is there or not the question is one of the countless debugthiscodeforme questions posted every day with little or any additional information such as results of debugging attempts etc really not the kind of thing many people myself included think so should be encouraging,0
the code seems perfectly fine im sure these compiler errors mean nothing,0
the code seems perfectly fine to me  general rule of thumb every time you think the compiler is wrong you are,0
go downvotes you can reach 10  ,0
wow genious program that corrects misspelled exerise into correct exercise,0
  i hate to scold but as long as the question is in salvageable english and makes some modicum of sense it should be edited and improved like any other posthttpblogstackoverflowcom200907nonenglishquestionpolicy,0
  you put much too much afford into a make my homework for mequestion,0
please try not to post duplicate answers especially not when the answer your copying has been posted years before and your answer adds no more value than the original,0
i do love doing other peoples homework do you,0
this question appears to be offtopic because googling python int is not too difficult,0
  thats not a reason to close the question just to downvote,0
this seems fairly straightforward to google or just try with an interpreter was there something you thought it did or should do that you found counterintuitive sometimes it helps to let folks know that you thought about something a bit and just where your confusion lies,0
you can start by googlinghttpswwwgooglecomqpurecssslideshowgwsrdcreighi5vjxfiirgywottig4dwqpurecssslideshow,0
if this is indeed a homework question i suggest you find another college where they ask meaningful questions,0
let me guess you copied the above code from some site but it doesnt do exactly what you need so you want someone to fix it for you,0
while the question is more or less straightforward and the answer provided so far is correct this indeed looks like a copypasta for a homework assignment left to the last minute i find it hard to believe one could have written the code provided and not know how to fix the above problem,0
  ya ma niggah finding easy way out niggah,0
  this isnt a discussion forum its a qa site ask an ontopic questionhttpstackoverflowcomhelpontopic,0
  1 thats not a question both because its a comment and doesnt actually contain a specific question 2 we dont do urgenthttpmetastackexchangecomq6506 3 we dont do explanationhttpmetastackoverflowcomq2538943001761 learn how this site works or leave,0
and how to load jquery in google didnt help,0
theres a new startup company called google that can actually search the interwebs for you and give you an answer to thisit isnt a very big or well known company but give them a shot,0
have you not attended a single class yet isnt this something thats covered you know in the class materials,0
im pretty sure that is covered by the msdn documentation,0
i smell homework,0
dont feel this question is too broad as it is asking what is generics in c a simple googling like angle brackets in c could have lead   to a yummy answer like in this link httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysbh15dyaaspx,0
you should read a beginners programming book first it seems like you do not understand the very basics of object oriented programming or any programming for that matter,0
so is not a code writing service at the very least show us your html and what jquery you have tried so far,0
this post shows no effort whatsoever in finding solution to your problem,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is about a typo and it serves no use beyond this single situation,0
the question is not clear the value of x is unknown no information about the error is given how do you expect us to help you,0
no i mean your question is irrelevant  your problem is wrong filename or wrong filename visible in windows what is your problem is filename ok,0
you meant to post this on your blog stack overflow is for questions,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is insane,0
  please use google for that mysql table limit rows,0
  there is a point for that  google something about partitioning and sharding but it is a rocket science,0
youre asking about general database scaling your questions range from entrylevel to seniordba level which is causing a lot of frustrating here youre not going to learn 5 years of experience in one questionanswer environment youve pointed out a lot of information that youve pieced together from the internet but its clear you dont understand all the implications start slow and work your way from there dont ask ridiculous questions and learn when youre out of your league thats the best thing you can take away from this question,0
google is your friend  how to open a url in a new window,0
why dont you come back when youve done some research and can show us some code,0
1 there are solutions all over google and theres a duplicate right here httpstackoverflowcomquestions726761javascriptopeninanewwindownottabrq1,0

swing does not support sleep  but it does allow for swing timers which is just as good if not better  nor does it allow you to parse ints in an event listener when the references come from an array  sorry but this is hogwash youve got a bug in your code if you need our help post the code and lets help you find your bug or you can rant your choice,0
ive tried to clean up the formatting now what the op must do is to debug the parse errors  to look and see exactly what each array item holds if it has an trailing or leading spaces punctuation or anything else that needs to be trimmed   you definitely have a bug in your code the parsing issue has nothing to do with swing and your posted code is helpful next time please follow our advice youve wasted at lot of time and our patience remember please that we are all volunteers,0
please tell me those are dummy names,0
rip naming conventions,0
so isnt a codewriting service could you demonstrate that youve at least tried something,0
try writing it yourself and folks here will be glad to help if you get stuck,0
  whats the point of giving an answer two an unclear question and then complaining about comments making exactly the assumptions you made for your “answer”,0
we still do not know the definition of man,0
you were hired as a web programmer at a company and you cant create a simple form with serverside code to send an email to a predefined address,0
i highly doubt your question is a good fit for this website please consult httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask being polite also helps,0
what have you researched yourself what exactly dont you understand as this is a fairly beginnerlevel question i assume youre learning from a good bookhttpstackoverflowcomq3882421782465 or tutorial how was it explained there and what parts of that explanation are unclear,0
by searching and remember the jvm doesnt know what vowel means youll have to write the algorithm yourself,0
at least try i can think of a million ways to do this,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because the question is overly broad and shows no evidence of prior effort,0
i like this kind of questions asap what you are willing to pay us,0
what have you tried so far stackoverflow is not for finding people to do your work but to help if youre stuck,0
it was a trivial question perhaps you can all go downvote this one too which has far less effort shown httpstackoverflowcomquestions1948152selectlast5elementswithjquery ,0
why would you post a response when youre not familiar with the topic,0
  why would you post a comment that isnt helpful at all to the question 15 years later,0
you are paroniac dude so far i have never downvoted anybody not just for this question,0
there are umptillion tutorials on the web that explain how css selectors work 1,0
like others would say rtfm  at least bother to lecture the basics before asking on so,0
  table returns more than 200 rows debugging for values for each row is almost impossible,0
debug 200 rows is almost impossible  almost as hard as formatting a question,0
you are totally wrong sorry,0
honestly the op does not demonstrate any effort to solve the questions on his own usually it is expected to introduce the problem in a clear and concise manner check and highlight the difficulties that have prevented from solving the problem himself not check,0
no body will answer this nor will iyou should start readingfor your reference httpideonecomq7zsme,0
please dont be so ridiculous with your edits it seems this question was mostly downvoted because of an unnecessary edit chain just leave it now will you,0
help with what youve only introduced your problem its like saying im maroun please help,0
google it you can find alot in stack overflow,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is about violating the tos of a third party site,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because this question is about violating the tos of a third party site,0
i am dead serious  you are saying that the code doesnt look right  so im asking what causes your suspicions  the code is syntactically correct although totally useless,0
this question is not what stackoverflow is for you should ask something that would help you not something about simple syntax how could anyone except php creator answer that if its correct  its correct,0
you have totally useless stuff with a right syntax the point that it does not make sense to you is right but you did not write a code to make sense for the computers  compiler i bet if they had an option to compile you  they would have thrown a null pointer exception on your brain,0
does swift have no documentation,0
alright easy now everybody i think 13 is more than sufficient,0
  i certainly wouldnt do it in production  for a dev box what does it matter its the easiest path to a reasonable facsimile of production,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because a simple attempt to run the code would have yielded the result,0
but you can try it for yourself observe the result and ask a question if the result is different  at which point your question can include the actual result alongside the reasoning for your expectation hint try reading the documentation for integerparseintstring first,0
  a word of warning  if you intend to become a professional programmer you are going to have to learn to look up documentation and to run programs if you want to know what happens when you run them your mother is not always going to be on hand to spoonfeed you your breakfast,0
no minimal research is done here,0
assuming this is homework namespace 1128 please show real effort and dont simply post the assignment i cant imagine what else the point of this assignment would be except to answer the question youre asking us,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because it does not appear to be asking about programming as defined by the help centerhttpstackoverflowcomhelp,0
this is a bad bad answer ,0
that first link is really a terrible terrible introduction to how to generate a normal distribution just awful and wrong please dont give it additional traffic by linking it,0
no  gaussian  randomnumber  sigma  median  this is completely wrong  unless randomnumber is gaussiannormal to start with,0
  please remove that gaussianrandomnumbersigmamedian equation it is hurting my eyes,0
why is this the accepted answer its factually wrong,0
this really stinks for    a few downvotes is not a big deal but because his incorrect answer was selected as the right answer his rep is taking a huge beating,0
and the documentation was no help here i rarely berate people for not googling but this would have been solved in 2 seconds by typing your title into a search engine,0
"  pieters removed comment 
my point was google it before you post here it takes me a great deal of effort and research before i post a question and id hope that others at least try to some extent",0
  absolutely and thats why this question is getting downvoted this much a quick google for perl time gave me the same info that ysth posted the op may need to pick up some more research skills first,0
oh man this is cleaner than anything i can think of  just hope some random copypaster from the interwebz doesnt shoot this directly into their console without looking at it ,0
study your math first then java,0
this is more a html question and a very silly mistake,0
did you read the code at all,0
its 2014 we can do better than this ,0
i would delete this answer to avoid the shame haha,0
error messages exist for a reason,0
  give me the reason and the solution to solve this problem ill give you a downvote instead,0
  so youre trying to learn c on the fly at a coding event oo,0
  yo welcome and never ask such type of silly questions its only making a junk in so,0
why dont you test yourself,0
try 10 as answer,0
this is not a site where we do your homework,0
consider taking a look at httpstackoverflowcomtour to learn how so works,0
whats wrong with that code you have there  its correct  that error you have provided is nonsense,0
  i rolled back you last change it invalidated the answer and your new question was only visible in the comment of the edit please accept the answer you received as it solved the problem you asked about if you have a new question ask a new question  not edit this one and maybe also learn how to ask good questions by reducing your code to an mcvehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,0
easy ton find on google ,0
you should really learn googleing and reading apis,0
we dont like screenshots without seeing how you created templist and on its hard to say whats wrong,0
i dont use classes or sprites or line breaks,0
  what exactly not working  post only the relevant part ,0
this hurts my eyes,0
too much code break it down,0
so many magic numbers,0
why even use java go straight to machine code,0
and the precision problems mentioned means that you cant use them as indexes the reasons really are endless you should dig into some computer history,0
really i mean by the time you wrote the question you could have done the calculation using your fingers,0
its funny how much attention this question is attracting,0
there are so many possibilties why not just use google or bing or whatever at first ,0
questions asking us to recommend or find a book tool software library tutorial or other offsite resource are offtopic for stack overflow,0
have you tried anything yet,0
dont bother it will be 76,0
this is not java,0
i hope you didnt write is less than,0
really none other than the ability to handle unicode in any encoding other than utf8 with all the performance issues with certain string operations that utf8 has or the fact that any desyncronisation between your string and your helper variable can lead to security issues,0
this answer is so wrong it makes me angry buffer overflows and encrypted data if nothing else,0
yes its a pithy and flippant answer that someone with nearly 60k reputation should know is unhelpful,0
the errors are quite selfexplanatory also please learn how to indent the code it will help a lot in the future,0
one think i am clear that your name is amol and no you havent spent two days for this problem,0
  you should try to find the solution yourself first this specific error is not rare especially when generated by the problem you have and if you rely on other people to tell you every time what to do its gonna be a long ride,0
  no this question is different it is still a bad question but different,0
in addition you might want to take a look at should hi thanks taglines and salutations be removed from postshttpmetastackexchangecomquestions2950shouldhithankstaglinesandsalutationsberemovedfromposts,0
what just execute your code in the else block,0
first of all fix your horrible formatting,0
sounds like a good question for your classmates or instructor your class is also a resource dont ignore it,0
this question has been asked many times before and you can find qhat you are looking for here there is no need to ask this question again,0
your code is unreadable bro,0
where did you get this code seems very strange code,0
from where you bring this code ,0
so is not a code writing service please show what you have tried and explain in what ways it does not work,0
this should be better,0
welcome to stack overflow you seem to be asking for someone to write some code for you stack overflow is a question and answer site not a codewriting service please see herehttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask to learn how to write effective questions,0
  dafuq really that doesnt make sense ,0
this is an incredibly bad researched question did you check the reference documentationhttpencppreferencecomwcppiocfprintf already what didnt you get from there,0
wouldnt a simple google search reveal this downvoting you can refer how to ask a question by checking httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask and how to create an example by reading this  httpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,0
  if you have not found on google that you can not create constructors outside a class you either didnt google at all or should really update both your knowledge of java and of howtogoogle,0
  this is not wrong  please read the question first  there is no reference to phone call,0
these are very basic rskills you will benefit a lot if you do some basic tutorials also taking some of your other questions into account in which you also have difficulties in very basic r operations,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because it appears to be too simple,0
did you thought through the code and algorithm,0
so is not a site for crowdsourcing your homework and i would like help is not a programming question,0
it this that homework again,0
go back and look at your notes read through your textbook and start working on it later if you have a specific question about something come back and ask and people will be a lot more willing to help you were not gonna do your homework for you,0
hi id strongly suggest that you had a look at the tourhttpstackoverflowcomtour to get a better idea of how so works so is not a teaching portal,0
this can easily be researched online question is far too broad as it stands for so,0
this is so well documented why are you fishing for reputation when you have so much already,0
come on you only need to try and compile that to know its not going to work,0
cant close this question as duplicate that is really poor,0
this is why i love stackoverflow my wife sometimes look at me awkwardly when i laugh while looking at code,0
what kind of sorcery is this please read how to askhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask page before asking any questions in the future please,0
who please dont come with question like that which will not serve to future user or current community,0
completely wrong,0
this is nonsense,0
does not work is not a technical term if you want to be a developer explain the problem in detail,0
next time post the real method instead of making it up from memory,0
pure codewriting requests are offtopic on stack overflow  we expect questions here to relate to specific programming problems  but we will happily help you write it yourself tell us what youve triedhttpwhathaveyoutriedcom and where you are stuck this will also help us answer your question better,0
  how about closing it as a dupe find all occurrences of a substring in pythonhttpstackoverflowcomq4664850 i will wait to hammer till i get your approval,0
you could have at least bothered to enter image description here as suggested,0
its something that you will find explained in every good c book,0
the question wasnt related in any way to this response this is a problem with kotlin as a language not kotlin on android and i think this is just sarcasm imho,0
  nevertheless posting his own answer after first trying to delete the question after taking advantange of diegos time makes him in4001 a bad actor,0
downvote reason so is not a write my code for me kind of website you should show your efforts,0
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

lol seriously",0
  this is a qa site not a qa site besideshttpblogstackoverflowcom201107itsoktoaskandansweryourownquestions,0
  theres nothing forbidden about answering your own questions although its not like this question has a lot of value its basic java syntax and people should have learned this during the first week of programming however it seems that a lot of the people dont bother reading the basic tutorials resulting in ridiculous questions,0
plus 1 for honestystraight as an arrow  havent tried anything,0
so its the second character now you could have mentioned that,0
  so whats the solution for that then,0
no it wont work,0
doesnt seem related to the question though,0
this has to be the weirdest answer i have ever seen,0
this is so basic i have to assume you did no research and made no effort to solve this yourself,0
  you seem be convinced that you know better than everyone out here then why are you asking no the result of s1concatdef wont go into the string pool and i cant understand what youre asking me,0
you did not receive attention because this question is totally opinion based as always every dev will call out for hisher favorite framework and you would have no more information at the end they can all do it but all requires a different level of expertise my suggestion would be  if you have expertise in any of those already go for it or try to get some expertise in the other and make the choice yourself based on what you can get from the different framework,0
this does not make any sense why would you want to convert an integer into a class they are two completely different types i propose you read about oo first,0
  you should consider changing your internship workplace,0
google for file io using c,0
i suggest studying c and then asking here this is way too basic and can be covered by any decent c book for beginners,0
your program wont even print anything until it has finished  almost forever and since you didnt initialise mpf it could print junk,0
rather that complaining about being required to write some text why not put some effort into writing a good question for example tell us what is project euler prob 3,0
 is usually called a colon not a double comma ive never heard it called anything but a colon but i dont know whether there are any regional differences ,0
theoretically it could be just as fast file a bug report to your cc compiler vendor please dont im being sarcastic,0
the question is a bit like asking why it takes longer to get your car out of the garage and drive to the corner shop than it does to walk,0
so how do you compile this nonsense c or c please first read about proper benchmarking there is more to doing it correctly than taking the time to loadexecuteterminate it,0
  i find this question quite terrible and the fact that you can write a nice bit of text doesnt redeem the question if you set me off on the right topic i might not need much prodding to rave on about it but that doesnt make the question any less lazy and misguided,0
  i guess i dont see it as much worse than some of the other dumb questions that get upvotes and involve serious misconceptions  i wish this had never been asked at all instead of being asked and then getting a notveryaccurate answer that misses the main reason for the observed behaviour  although the accepted answer does at least correct the misunderstanding that c is 2x slower than asm  inaccurate answers make me crazy,0
what else would you expect to happen if you do something twice it gets done twice,0

you say you cant use group by because your instructor said so but that youre doing this exercise for your own practice how does that work,0
what are you trying to do and why would you want to do it this way  this is not cleaver coding clever coding is doing the minimum possible to achieve the result in this case cout   2  4    24 would  work  maybe you could look at templates they might suit your needs better,0

because it doesnt support it its like asking why an automobile cant fly also your example usage is nonsense,0
looks like you are trying to hack something,0
before adding a bounty to your question at least go through the motion of making it a real question no one has any real idea as to what youre actually after my intuition is that this is an xy problemhttpmetastackexchangecomquestions66377whatisthexyproblem please clean up your question see to the help centerhttpstackoverflowcomhelp for further reference,0
this definitely smacks of an xy question could the poster provide any type of background about why the artificial constraints hes imposed are practical in some way,0
why does the output include apple and not include mango  why does the output not include the new first column  where did the 0 in the example output come from  why is a row with 456 chosen when neither such row contains purchased  in other words your desired output doesnt bear any obvious relation to the conditions specified in the question or the sample input data,0
 sorry the desired output was correct but i was wrong with the run command which i have changed now the nulls are replaced as zero let me know if you can help me now ,0
within a selection  what selection a range in a worksheet that has the worksheet names the selected worksheets what do you mean by that also what have you tried  so is not a code writing service let us know what youve tried what failed any error messages etc and we can help you we dont tend to write from scratch,0
  many have come here to help we cannot do such with the information given there are too many possible answers  brucewayne and matthewd are two of the best at doing this  when they asked question to clarify your question you assumed you knew more  your assumptions about us are such a generalization that it begs the question why we would ever help  many of us work in the it and many others do not  we are a large community that i am sure include ceos to street sweepers  we do this not for the glory but to help  your attitude is uncalled for,0
heres how you select a worksheet worksheetssheetnameselect if its in a range for each cel in rng worksheetscelvalueselect next cel except i have a feeling thats not what you want if you cant be helpful for us we cant help you you say youve looked thoroughly  where have you looked this kind of thing is something that is used all the time and you should be able to find ample resources  can you please post in your op what youve tried how it worked differently from what you expect and please expand on what you mean by selecting a worksheet in a range,0
learning c from videos seems to be error prone well i never tried so being educating myself old school ways from books and practising but your track seems to be a weak one,0
there is no way that you couldnt find the answer to this by google searching,0
people think you didnt google hard enough,0
the downvotes are mainly because you didnt read google or even bother to provide in the question the error message,0
youve got 72 rep points  and so surely you know how to post well formatted code by now right you also know that if code is well formatted it is more easily understood right,0
the scope of any exam is to test your knowledge of the topic asking an urgent or lastminute question on so defiles that scope plus your question isnt fit for so anyway for many reasons see herehttpstackoverflowcomhelp,0

i would like an advancement payable to me asap if i answer this simple question for you what have you actually done and or tried also please read the following how to ask a questionhttpstackoverflowcomquestionsask,0
this does not make any sense what are you  trying to achieve,0
   apparently it does not make any sense to a few other people as well,0
nay alas you have to solve your homework on your own we all had to go through that ,0
share your code and we can help you with some guidelines nobody here will do the homework for you,0
its sort of an if you have to ask youre not yet ready to know question but basiles answer has some splendid arrows in the right direction to me the real question is not so much why you thought basic types and keywords were defined anywhere but specifically why you in stdioh,0
does that question indeed poorly asked deserve so many downvotes,0
hint if you tell people not to downvote the question lots of them will do exactly that plz do not downvote is a cue that the question probably needs to be downvoted either way that is just noise that does not belong in a question i have edited it out here and otherwise improved the clarity of your question please do not add it back in there is nothing you can do about how people decide to vote if the question is useful and clear you will generally get more upvotes than downvotes which makes up for it in the end complaining about it in the comments is also discouraged,0
questions asking us to recommend or find a book tool software library tutorial or other offsite resource are offtopic for stack overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam instead describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it,0
please take the tour and visit ask as well as the checklisthttpmetastackoverflowcomquestions260648stackoverflowquestionchecklist your question isnt particular well asked and deserves a better title after that i guess it is also a duplicate,0
you should go back some lessons and learn the meaning of main and executables your code contains nothing but implementations of how to do something but actually does nothing,0
  see all the functions you wrote none of them are ever being executed because youre not calling them anywhere,0
yeah there is something off about this question,0
i did go and read the whole thing like you said and indeed i wept but mainly at the stupidity of felix which i dont think was what you were trying to get across,0
you seem very resolute on your stance concerning the standard being broken may i ask if you have a defect report on the way,0
  its integer overflow it happens obviously it is wrong for the compiler to assume that it doesnt its that assumption which is wrong not the fact that the call removed was an assert it should not be ub at all it should be defined to either wrap 2scompliment or trap and those are the only sensible things for a compiler to do assuming it cant happen in 2015 when all know it is a major source of security bugs is not innocent nor even stupid its malice,0
anybody who is pitying safety versus performance should just switch to java,0
downvoted for the useless rant they are  introducing bugs on purpose perhaps for a foreign government really this isnt rconspiracy,0
  you have to stop thinking these things are accidents havent you been paying attention two  thats two  unknown parties subverted juniperos we kind of assume one was the nsa but who was the other,0
decent programmers over and over again repeat the mantra do not invoke undefined behaviour yet these nonks have gone ahead and done it anyway and look what happened i have no sympathy whatsoever this is the developers fault simple as that they need to take responsibility remember that personal responsibility people relying on your mantra but what about in practice is precisely how this situation arose in the first place avoiding nonsense like this is precisely why standards exist in the first place code to standards and you wont have a problem period,0
they dont read the compiler release notes they assume the compiler writer is on their side and if they work for me they are subsequently fired for gross incompetence seriously who calls themselves a programmer yet doesnt bother to read release notes when they upgrade their entire toolchain to a new major revision defending that behaviour with the ridiculous the standard is wrong is just absurd is the c standard perfect absofrickinglutely not but its right in this case and even if it werent your rationale is mortifyingly flawed,0
  im amazed nobody stepped in to tell felix to calm down what a douche nine years on i wonder where he is now,0
it goes against the c groupthink but this is the only correct answer to this question  they just dont care about whether they break existing widelyused previouslyworking code and the c community is too broken to recognize that,0
with all due respect i would put money on the bug being with your code and not the compiler,0
your program seems to have a split personality disorder it cant decide whether its c or c,0
  be as harsh as you want but my point still stands  its much more likely for a problem to be with your own code than with the compiler and its a mark of inexperience to assume the opposite,0
  dont ge me wrong i am definitely not saying the problem is from the compiler then you should change your question title to something more meaningful also provide a mcve including a detailed description of the problem and what you did observe when stepping through your program code with the debugger after you did all that you probably solved your problem without asking here at all,0
asked thousand times google your title which you should have done before youve asked this,0
then you need to work on your googling skills  i feel like i see this question asked and closed as a dupe every other day,0
   yes and the answer is there are too many people who dont know how to research  once a question as simple to find as this has been asked once it should not be asked again,0
frustating is to see people who dont care to invest a minimum effort on research,0
googled first buddy,0
in general we want you to post a selfcontained question  giving us the link to buy the book on amazon really doesnt cover the required background  i expect that youre not allowed to post the applicable material from the book as a result this question wont be appropriate for stackexchange,0
probably this is referring to a different context than the one you think it refers to wtf alex,0
this site is not for interview us,0
i guess im committing some capital sin here can anyone please explain which,0
your question is so vague and open ended that youd have attracted close votes but a question with a bounty cant be closed so you get downvotes instead,0
youre essentially asking stackoverflow users to write code for your specific use case on their own time if you cant figure out those academic papers hire someone who can,0
you dont provide much enough information in my opinion my first thought was convolution but if it doesnt need to be that precise then just a simple high pass filter to find the words and gaps may be adequate the negativity may be that it isnt a programming question co much as a signal analysis question and by making it a programming question it comes across as write my code,0
also so is not a forum,0
hey girl with pearl earring  you could possibly ask a question like this on the gamedevcom site where general techniques can be discussed  quite simply this site is for asking about specific bugs in code this site has nothing to do with general technique discussion  so find the better site to ask your question on,0
this is insane,0
somebody had a bad day  its true there are many situations where bypassing certificate validation is useful,0
wrt if i ever notice that that question has been reopened then i will delete this copy and reproduce my answer there what are you going to do if the answer you should end up accepting isnt yours,0
  i dont see a problem what are you imagining,0
  someone posts a bright shining solution to this question the old question gets reopened so you copy your solution into the old question and delete this question and said bright shining solution to the original question is gone from posterity i didnt downvote this btw,0
  i dont follow is this a complaint about me chasing points i have updated the original question to improve the english but i still cant post a solution there that doesnt seem to be how so wants to work there is also a commandline solution as well as my own win all round,0
  its not a complaint about anything i was simply asking what youre going to do with answers this question receives other than your own ifwhen the old question is reopened and you delete this question after duplicating your own answer under the old question  are you going to contact the other posters of answers to move their answers from here to the old question and wait for that to happen before you close this question or are you going to copy their answers into yours in the old question with some accreditation comment or do nothing or something else,0
please learn how to ask questions on so,0
you do not seem familiar with the c language at all i would suggest you at least get the basics before trying to implement anything  you will save time,0

this is my code but i get an error  do we have to beg for you to tell us what the error is,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because so is no homework service,0
so is not a personal service for your homework,0
and people in hell want ice water whats your point questions should be posed in the form of a question,0
before raising an question try to search in google you can get a lot of stuff,0
did you google it you will get lot of results also did you try to read official docs and why jdk 5 now its old,0
his teacher may not have told him about contains yet,0
for the sake of your next issues on php try to type your intent on google followed by the word php and i swear you wont be regret theres plenty of material starting with its official documentation that covers every single bundled function for array purposes if you cant find your answers at all then you can consider asking here at so since a research effort has been made before it,0
not a good option as this is not a standard interchange format,0
too poor answer i think this is a bad option because dont use or implement a standar,0
may i just say you are tenacious keeping an answer posted with a current score of 15 that has collected 23 downvotes  i didnt downvote btw,0
because your question deserves them you have int32 c  converttoint32mathsqrtc2 and asking what happened to my decimal fraction needs down votes,0
the whole point of the teacher assigning this exercise is for you to figure it out on your own by studying the rules of operator order and precedence getting us to explain it to you defeats the purpose,0

youre going to have to give a lot more information to get help,0
this really is very basic sas you dont appear to have made any effort in attempting it first  i suggest you look up proc means have a go at getting the answer then post a new question if you have any specific problems,0
maybe you should take a look at google first there are many examples for such typical crud implementations out on the internet problem with this question is that it cannot really be answered without a huge effort since basically what you ask here is explain to me everything i need to know for programming php working with a database knowing about patterns  this site is to ask specific questions about implementation details,0
each of these lines is either documented pretty well or there exist tons of resources about it the only reason why i dont vote to close this question is that theres no option user is too lazy to do basic research,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because the author ought to be able to answer this for themselves with a minimum of reading and effort,0
why are you asking a question before even trying to compile code if you did youd notice that theres a syntax error in there thats because  is not a valid operator its probably a typo of ,0
have you ever heard of google ,0
you could get an answer by simply google the error,0
it is not an operator and it is easy enough to look it up,0
its almost like documentation doesnt exist,0
if you put your exact question title to google youd get the answer in the very first link,0

vishal that is some of ugliest solutions i ever saw please take your time to fully understand what david is trying to tell you,0
this is like saying i dont know how to unlock my car with the key but hey look i managed to open it by smashing the window with a brick,0
  that doesnt make any sense dont say anything whatever comes to your mind if you understand correctly i recently said that the form is creating directly and this form1 is a variable is automatically declared the moment i created this form at design time so the way form is created and in formshow event atleast form1 object should not be nil then i reapeat again for you since form1 was nil thats why i tried to create it now say for eample if i need to call any method of tform1 class in ttest class method on some other button click event then how do i call it ,0
  rd if somebody respect others then there is point in respecting them for me too i find this is the ugliest way of communicating by talking about others ability i dont want to continue about that topic any more since i dont value such ppl there are better way to convey your message and he is not something indigenous,0
  in the code is your comment with tform1create  you create an instance of tform1 but that doesnt assign the result to your form1 variable  thats why form1 is still nil  if you spent less time commenting about imagined slurs and more time taking the trouble to understand what people are saying you would have fewer of these problems,0
 martyna thanks for your advance suggestion but if you little bit try to understand i am not unnecessarily interested in wasting my words with such not useful comments the code i shared what would you do if you need to access tform1s methods via ttest method  better you stop suggesting what should i do and what i should not i think you are not understanding what i wrote in my lat post about my comments dont have so much of selfesteem,0
  you have two problems here first your coding skills are quite poor and second you are dismissing solutions from people far more knowledgeable than you are in order to improve your skills first you have to admit to yourself that you are not the best programmer ever and then start listening to what others are saying to you your solution is not proper solution it works but you will never get better programmer if you just stick to what just works without understanding what is going on in code take david heffernans answer and learn from it,0
the design of this unit is incorrect you can defend what youve done all you like but that doesnt make it any better heres the fundamental flaw the form cannot create itself as you did initially the global variable form1 is initialized outside the form when its created by the project file secondly  onshow is not where you initialize the form that should be done inside of oncreate onshow is called every time a showmodal occurs your code isnt calling showmodal its not even calling create which is when oncreate is called once self and form1 are referring to the same object,0
if you need to access tform1s methods via ttest method  then you need to inject tform1 into ttest somehow like via constructor injection the way youre doing it is completely wrong it might work but from an oodoop standpoint its wrong the whole approach is wrong anyway but youre not listening to anything any of us have to say in that respect yes its entirely possible to get an improperly designed bunch of classes to work so what you have not explained the role of ttest and nobody is sure what its for absent that all we can do is point out obvious flaws in the design,0
  believe me i understand what you did much better than you think there was no need to try and explain i understand why you had the problem in the first place i understand how you came up with your solution i understand why your solution is wrong and i know how to solve your problem correctly i will post an answer explaining all this to you in your comments youve said you want productive and useful answers if youre interested in learning please read my answer carefully,0
this is easy to achieve and sounds like homework where is your research effort please read how to askhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask and edit your question after show what you have tried so far and what your thoughts are to solve this problem,0
actually the biggest question is why dont you start with the basics as in put your code into a method it is possible to put to simply put a   block into your class directly this is called a initializer block but for a newbie most likely that is not what you want instead you want to study how java classes should be structured in general hint add a mainmethod then start writing few lines of code when you think this looks ok it should compile then run the compiler repeat instead of writing 20 30 lines of code  and then trying to isolate the syntax errors within,0
please dont shout edit ive removed the shouting for you and other irrelevancies please look at the edit so you know what to do for next time more details about what you think is wrong would also be good,0

yeah this screams malware any self respecting security software is going to block this,0

see how many similar items are in related section,0
please read ask you are supposed to show compilable code or if you have a syntactic question show the problematic line and the compilation error message but one error per line is really too much,0
preferably trying to avoid structs and do it without them  so you refuse using the language feature meant for this for some arcane reason sorry but stack overflow is dedicated to enhance code quality not degrade it,0
what have you tried so far so isnt a code writing service,0
c and c are different languages unless youre specifically asking about differences between them dont tag both,0
i think that you should search more if you atleast did before posting questions about basics i also suggest that you learn java with some documentationbookanything that details how java works precisely it may be a bit more harsh than just trying things but thats how you can learn,0
it looks like you want us to write some code for you while many users are willing to produce code for a coder in distress they usually only help when the poster has already tried to solve the problem on their own a good way to demonstrate this effort is to include the code youve written so far example input if there is any the expected output and the output you actually get console output tracebacks etc the more detail you provide the more answers you are likely to receive check the faq and ask,0

  what makes you think a character is being returned it seems you should read a c tutorial or book,0

your jsfiddle is useless since you havent included jquery you are aware that your source code requires the jquery library right if not then i suggest you read things before grabbing free source code and trying to paste it into your own stuff,0
why are you exposing both getters and setters its just strange and unnecessary especially after saying in the university didnt learn us how to use the debugger,0
the comparison operator  looks like a pair of earplugs not sure why i thought of that just happened to cross my mind,0

sorry but the harsh truth is you have no idea what you are doing you have no idea about super basic java stuff but still you want to engage in android coding sorry again but that will not work you will run from one frustrating problem into the next one the only thing that makes sense step back and learn about java first then in a few weeks come back and look into android,0

welcome to stack overflow please take the tour have a look around and read through the help in particular how do i ask a good questionhelphowtoask,0
the right tool to solve such problems is your debugger you should step through your code linebyline before asking on stack overflow for more help please read how to debug small programs by eric lipperthttpsericlippertcom20140305howtodebugsmallprograms at a minimum you should edit your question to include a minimal complete and verifiablehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve example that reproduces your problem along with the observations you made in the debugger,0
what have you tried i dont see any effort here so is not a code writing service besides this type of functionality has been covered millions of times before,0
did you read the php reference manual  theres well documented methods for both dealing with comma separated strings and with type conversion,0
is this for an assignment or for fun  i ask because there may be simpler ways to do this than an array,0
welcome to stack overflow  please read the about and ask pages soon  also read about how to create an mcve how to create a minimal complete verifiable examplehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve aka an sscce short selfcontained correct examplehttpsscceorg  there seems to be a lot of code in the question,0
have you tried anything before posting it here ,0
you still refuse to add comments or otherwise improve your coding style or even just explain the purpose of your code,0
 it wont even help you because the post is still publicly visible in the edit history also mods will stop you eventually,0
your questions isnt clear and makes very little sense,0
this is not a link finding service google exists for that exact purpose this site is for programming questions please spend some time taking the tour and reading through the help pages before posting your next question here,0
the error message tells you exactly what is wrong and exactly what you need to do to fix it what more do you want from us the first thing you should learn is that the words in error messages contain meaning and that you need to read them in order to get that information,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because the error message already says exactly how to resolve the problem so its unclear what the issue is please also see why is “can someone help me” not an actual questionhttpmetastackoverflowcomq284236,0

those errors are pretty self explanatory to elaborate on them would take a whole bookhttpsstackoverflowcomquestions388242thedefinitivecbookguideandlist,0
why are you declaring a method in a forloop thats probably whats wrong and youre losing reference to the i but you should go back to basics with c and stack overflow isnt a place for beginners to ask whats wrong with my code,0
it has a lot of errors fix them learn thats why you are doing homework,0
did you try reading the errors since typically the errors tell exactly whats wrong,0
yes youre not going to have a good time if your methodology for learning a language is trial and error throwing code at a wall and hoping it eventually takes the correct shape probably through people online fixing it for you thats not a good use of anyones time,0

i dont know java but if there is a way which i doubt dont do it,0
  you seriously should revise the way youre asking questions and reflect how so works what did you try so far did you try anything at all google for instance,0
this isnt of any help,0

   to be fair war was how i learned much of the python i do today  then again i had read up on a few tutorials beforehand,0
not only that you dont show any research effort at all your question isnt clear enough,0
really if youcant do this you shouldnt do ios development youll damage the system one day,0
are you taking the exam right now ,0
casting integer to a pointer no thanks,0
what about real code and real error messages,0
its really long you wouldnt care to read it so i shortened it,0
let us decide whether we want to read it or not always post full error messages,0
  if you are able to decide what information is necessary to solve that problem and what not i wonder why you werent able to solve the problem yourself,0
you know read the documentation,0
it wouldnt even matter anyway,0
dont just post code but also write your question along side it just putting the question in the title is not good practice and hurts readability,0
i have already stated that i have tried creating project from scratch hope you have properly read the question,0
this isnt a place to ask for free work attempt something on your own when youre stuck post your code and ask for help,0
please show some effort at least in googling the question,0
so whats the question ,0
it seems that you need a python tutorialhttpdocspythonorg2tutorial,0
search google how to python,0
there is nowhere near enough information for us to help you add the moment  please expand your question with code examples and what your current issue is,0
what do you mean,0
this answer is so bad i want to downvote it more than once,0
"httpstackoverflowcomquestions5655674openingthesettingsappfromanotherapp

make search before posting questions",0
so is for techincal problem google will help you,0
this solution is simple readable and obvious,0
try to do some research before posting this is really a basic question,0
"this is a relatively basic question but the reason im downvoting it is because you have not provided enough information for anyone to give you an answer

to make the question appropriate you should at the least describe or provide the structure of the tables you want to query  in addition you may want to specify if you are querying using sql linq or some other accessor",0
same home work problem here with a few answers httpsstackoverflowcomquestions45406235selectdateandtimeinsql10pmupto6ameverydaynoredirect1comment7777453845406235,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is about a typo,0
downvoting because this answer is misleading described features of arraylist are found in the list too,0
hahah  i have problem what is answer,0
please consider searching the stackoverflow threads and other mediums before posting a question additionally make sure you post a question showing what you have tried,0
you mean like google,0
what do you want to know you have a method signature and an example call there is nothing more to be said about the code you posted,0
why am i garnering minuses on my question is it because people dont know the answer and want to take it out on the asker,0
codeinchaos how would you use this how is it useful how is it a method signature im used to seeing like public int testint a string b if it were like that it would make more sense,0
  and boltclock yes it is c if i put it into a solution it doesnt yell at me and even provides intellisense for the test method if indeed that is what it is as for compiling it nothing seems to happen it doesnt yell at me at the very least,0
that doesnt look like real sourcecode i cant think of a context where these two lines would compile if you claim that it compiles please post a compilable sample its just the method signature with an omitted body since documentation usually doesnt contain the method body,0
is this the full code sample,0
please post the link to the original doxygen example,0
not even the version you posted now compiles you cant have a method with no body inside a class,0
i ran it in vs2010 runs and compiles but does nothing,0
  doesnt compile for me,0
is this homework if not this is a remarkably bad method to do this operation,0
also if working fine means that the binary equivalent of 0xff is 1515 somethings wrong with my math skills,0
you should look in the forums first before posting questions that have been already answered,0
  son where did i cry ive just tried to explained to you that you didnt understand what im asking about,0
  9 out of ten persons who know c and qt if you tell them words signalslot will immediately associate this with typical qt pattern one will not i feel sorry for you,0
  also there are persons who by reading tags c qt would immediately associate this question as a qt specific as ive said i feel sorry for you,0
how are you applying the expression please post your code also please clarify what you mean with but none of them seemed to work what exactly does not work what is the result you get d only matches a single digit 09 matches the whole string if it contains at least on digit it appears you want d,0
wellstay cool  jcrowder sorry if im not as good as you i failed  ok can i,0
this question should probably have the homework tag,0
  and all that vote down thank you for your down votes now i cant ask more questionsi dont understand why you think this question will not help future visitors i tryed to find the answer to my problem and couldnt find any so here it is if someone have the same problem in the future here is the answer the knowledge is so vast that no one knows everything and sometimes its the little things we do not know that make all the difference,0
formatting your code and data sure makes a difference we put effort into our answers for you please put some effort into your questions for us,0
please have a look at the faqhttpstackoverflowcomfaq on how to ask a good question and also maybe read this what have you triedhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
yes there is a way but youll need to show your actual html and javascript that youre trying to do this with were not going to write it for you,0
can you show us how did you assign the id to your tag,0
this question shows a huge lack of effort both in researching and phrasing without actual code,0
you have to be more specific how do you want to send it do you have an established connection with the server what protocol can it be socet or has to webservice,0
i hope you arent making something sneaky  like a virus,0
1 since no efforts made to search answer,0
what fiddle where exactly is the problem,0
still looking for possible description or even solution to this cause i do need that clean file hierarchy by pip but with setuppy way,0
  in what way is this incorrect just because pip expects a setuppy it does not mean that pip does not provide any other behaviour,0
dude you answer is just plain wrong and downvoting my answer wont change that,0
  how is my answer wrong the reason op does not get exactly the same behaviour from setuppy as from pip is because they are not the same programme nor are they supposed to be whether or not he could use some combination of switches to achieve that is irrelevant,0
  are you trolling,0
  are you im answering the question that was asked,0
  that still does not make my answer misleading as you so charmingly put it,0
  by strict literalism yes you have correctly answered the question but the details are relevant its pretty clear that the op wants some understanding of why they behave differently or a way to modify the behaviour of one its like answering why do i perceive red differently from blue with because theyre different colours correct but useless,0
  where would we be if we constantly asked trivial questions different things are different if op wants to know about the implementation he is free to look at the source,0
  youre trolling arent you,0
  certainly not are you trolling you are the one who is defending a question that amounts to why are two distinct things not the same,0
  in neither case does the mechanism answer the why question it amounts to a restatement of the fact that the programmeeye works in a particular way you are essentially complaining that i didnt make up a question that like more and choose to answer that,0
  the very fact that you identify three possible topics shows that all that can be provided is general information of some kind so is not about making up your own better question and answering it,0
  so is not about providing unhelpful overlyliteral answers to provide useful information we often have to infer a better question the vote counts on these answers suggest other users think that providing some useful information is better than a literal but unhelpful answer,0
  bzzzt thats an ad hominem thanks for playing,0
  i dont have to there are plenty of comments already fyi ive also flagged that for moderator attention as not an answer you keep using so answers to boost your ego wo any benefit to the community you will get downvoted,0
its subtraction multiplication addition and square root kap which part of that do you need to know how to do,0
  youll never convince those flatearthers,0
   really i dont quite understand what you mean by neither of the formulas works,0
google for great circle route,0
what have you tried are you getting errors do you have some code you can show please give examples of your array of words and your input string how it starts and what it should look like at the end,0
how big is your dataset that you need the fastest way to do it,0
we cant help you if you dont show what youve tried so far and what specific problems youre having,0
yes it is possible what have you tried google is your friend,0
people will only put effort into responses if you put effort into your question requests to write code your code will probably be ignored requests for help in a specific area or a specific sample would have a better chance of response,0
  considering his rep i think he just has not had his morning coffee yet,0
  oh dont judge people by their rep considering the code he have not a slightest idea what does his code do,0
this question isnt particularly well phrased  it took the comments on the answers to actually work out whats really being asked,0
i strongly suspect youve misdiagnosed the issue please show a short but complete program demonstrating the problem,0
your code the one you haven’t posted is almost comically wrong this is why it’s important that you post all the relevant code questions like this just waste everybody’s time,0
  i wonder how you can judge that is comical if you havent seen it if you dont know the answer to the question how to prevent optimization on a class field in c please feel free to not waste your time with it,0
what have you tried so farhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
this is a very generic description of your problem not an actual specific question please see httpblogstackoverflowcom201010askingbetterquestions and try googling on how to ask productive questions that we will love to answer,0
it helps if you include code showing people what you are trying to do or how its being applied otherwise it sounds like you want someone to write it for you,0
facepalm its help with the code im asking for i have not written any code yet with this omg,0
thats not code thats an explanation people are not here to write the code for you,0
youre pretty much asking people to write the whole program for you   try doing it step by step yourself and ask specific questions as specific technical challenges come up,0
no you will need to learn how to debug code besides this looks like a learning exercise so what good does it make to ask a broad fix my code question wheres the learning in that,0
but you havent said what the problem is should we guess what you need help with all you have done is posting a bunch of code without any description of your problem whatsoever you havent even said what sorting algorithm youre trying to implement,0
is this homework this is the third time ive seen this same question from different people in the past few days,0
stan why should anybody need to figure out your question ask the question and take your time to explain it be precisehttpwwwcatborgesrfaqssmartquestionshtmlbeprecise and explicithttpwwwcatborgesrfaqssmartquestionshtmlexplicit most people answering here wont copy your code and try to run it we read your problem description and run the code in our heads trying to see where things goes wrong,0
well why should i waste 2 hours searching for an answer so far the only similar questions were sorting words or using the sort method so why not,0
 ethis theres no meaningful difference between sorting numbers or words the algorithm would be the sameand there are tons of examples in many languages showing tons of algorithms the issue isnt however one of what youre trying to doits with the question itself,0
 ethis editing your two downvoted questions is likely hopeless id start over but heres the thingdont just say help me with the code describe precisely what isnt working what your expectations are in detail eg not just it should sort the numbersno shit youre writing a sort algorithm unless its a bogosort or random sort we assume you want them in some order and so on,0
1 comeon people this is no way to ask a question,0
1 httpwwwemilvikstromsewhyidownvotehtml what have you tried what have you read what is your question,0
please learn to use the search function on stack overflow this question has been asked many many times before,0
no one is going to write your code for you check out some jquery tutorials and read through the documentationhttpdocsjquerycommainpage and come back when you run into a specific issue or problem,0
we dont know what your errors are what your code looks like what you are trying to do  so how can we possibly help,0
very basic stuff 1 second google httpphpnetmanualenreservedvariablespostphp,0
no you can not do that from a website and i am very glad you can not also controlaltdelete is meant not to be able to be captured by a normal program as a security feature so that you know that the resulting prompt could only be from windows itself,0
"i want user to fill answer sheet on comp but they can easily take answers from their hard drive

is there any way",0
to be honest you are all a bit quick to judge from the question alone there are valid applications where stuff like this is useful or even mandatory cashpoints school assignments kiosk apps in production lines ,0
   we were quick to judge because the question did not contain important relevant information  the phrase kiosk app would have prevented all the aggro  the point is that such apps as you mention are run on secure hardware often with special humaninterfaces eg keypads touchscreens not a standard pc keyboard  the desire of the op can certainly be met on xp anyway as anyone who has used a hotel lobby payperminute internet kiosk will know but im not sure how its done  its probably nontrivial,0
what exactly are you asking,0
  then next time dont tag java,0
did you just list every language you know,0
if you want a generic solution theres an language agnostic tag you should be using,0
have you tried it,0
did you try it and why not also even if it is valid syntactically it is not wise because of the semantics to use an int with the name π as you might have heard of it π is a mathemathical constant,0
not just code explain what youre trying to do in code next the problem,0
i dont know what you are doing with your edits here you have added a huge block of code and other information twice once before it got reopened and then you removed it and added it back recently,0
   see the discussion here httpmetastackexchangecomquestions189591issosprogrammerssiteabetterplaceforadvancedquestions189595189595,0
first of all you should learn objectivec,0
what doesnt work what error do you get what have you done to troubleshoot this,0
this makes no sensereturns a constant if you initialize the variables and doesnt even compile because you use uninitialized variables,0
if the guy types in haha lol xd  then you should probably beat the crap out of him,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is toolocalised,0
did you try looking for loop javascrip or javascript interval  do it,0
come one whats the code youve attempted,0
good luck getting one  i would expect these to be totally identical,0
a logical explanation of what exactly why theyre nearly identical because theyre essentially the same comparison,0
this is horrible advice  and only artificially extends how many more fragments you can pack in  this problem still remains google explicitly states not to use this to address memory leaks,0
you should never store the password in plaintext,0
if you guys dont like my opinion just post something else it is a matter of opinion after all i changed some of my phrasings i think some people got very sentimental about this,0
lovely idea but this is not how it works your reply is not an answer and shouldnt have been posted as one,0
  an altogether wrong answer is still an answer,0
completely incorrect answer,0
yeah this doesnt work produces an exact duplicate of the gif,0
ive never seen a 23 answer before err sorry 24,0
unlucky the guys answer got accepted because that pins the answer up you often only see a few because they sink to the bottom pretty quickly so nobody pays attention to it ,0
whenever you learn a new language the first thing you should read are the operators read the reference before posting,0
very basic question that smells like homework,0
   you need to understand how to accomplish it someone else doing it wont help i really suggest pp  paper pencil,0
did you forget to have coffee today,0
please provide what you have tried so far,0
 is an unary operator socalled not do googling about c operators unarybitwise ones,0
yea wwwgooglecom,0
do some research before posting quest here,0
what help do you want and what have you tried,0
so what have you tried,0
and you want we create your code,0
no effort shown  no database mentioned,0
you could have easily got the answer by a simple google search  check this  httpwwww3schoolscomsqlsqltopasp,0
questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved include attempted solutions why they didnt work and the expected results,0
is that a question,0
lucky im not a compiler,0
you dont need to write the type down but if you cant figure it out on your own that just means you dont actually know what your program does,0
this code does not do any validation,0
thats the answer i gave 3 hours ago when you asked,0
still shouldnt be used at it looks horrible and devs maintaining your markup in the future will think its okay to reuse if youve used it  and they may not style out its inherent ugliness in practice its to be avoided,0
personally id avoid the thickness as it looks chunky,0
upvote means this question shows research effort it is useful and clear and at least 5 people on stackoverflow think this question meets that criteria,0
not sure why the question got closed p,0
i want to know what maven is  i want you to show me foreigner,0
this is your third question on a very similar theme if you were to give a better explanation of what you are trying to do eg why you want your data in an array not a dataframe then perhaps help would be more readily offered,0
you may want to explain you answer a bit more it also doesnt seem to address the question which is asking how to create an array of lists not how to print anything out,0
what have your triedhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
what are you even trying to do could you explain clearly what html youve got what the user interaction is and what result you expect then well at least understand the question which is a start,0
you really need to show us your html and your javascriptjquery even if its not working show what youve tried link us to a demo at js fiddlehttpjsfiddlenet js binhttpjsbincom or similar please help us to help you,0
you need to clarify people suggest to use prototype instead of innerhtml where did you read this show the link as it is i can only guess the people mean using prototypejs library,0
you didnt know that link before you made your question and comment about people suggesting prototype so i think youre trolling,0
  dont accept a answer just to say thanks i thought you needed a java script solution but coder proposed a c solution,0
just wasted time if you do that,0
voting to close as nonconstructive → soliciting debate arguments,0

sorry but were not here to debug your code for you,0
this isnt a forum httpmetastackexchangecomquestions92107isstackoverflowaforum9211092110,0
if you could give a specific error message stack trace etc then we would be able to help you more general heres my code whats wrong questions arent received well  so run your code through the debugger and see what blows up ,0
very bad suggestion especially when your entire impression of razor is based on every sample ive seen rather than personal experience,0
what have you triedwhat is the code that generates the page  your question shows no effort on your part that youve attempted to solve this yourself,0
googlecom  so 90 of the time,0
wait what you want me to help you steal a bunch of usernames and passwords,0
this isnt a place to have your script written for you search for perl open on how to open and read your file youll probably need some regexes to figure out whats a heading and whats a variable,0
why on earth are you doing three different queries to get data from your members table  youre selecting a field you already have in the first query some not necessarily related users encrypted password in the next query and then youre selecting every single userid in your members table,0
  its not really just a php thing its a working with relational databases thing and sort of a basic logic thing too  write out what you want your code to do verify that it makes sense and youre not adding a bunch of extra steps then write the actual code,0
what did you try,0
how is this parallel at all thats totally sequential i dont know why op accepted this as an answer,0
i dont see any question neither any description of what youve tried so far voting to close the question as not a real question,0
so is not your blog what does it mean to learn jquery before javascript that makes no sense,0
non sequitur  thanks,0
i think jquery is far more than just a javascript library no its just a library,0
we aint doing your homework for you show us your code explain what problem youre encountering and then we can help you,0
this answer doesnt absolutely reflect the point of question the asker wants no view controller,0
  i believe i already did globals are bad and what you have in your code are fancy globals i suggest you watch the videos in tereskos answer,0
just in case anyone reading this answer in the future thinks it is correct it is not mattmcdonalds answer is leaps and bounds better than this also never listen to w3schools they do not know what they are talking about and will misguide you,0
there are c to vbnet converters on the internet that can give you a big head start on a lot of this stuff,0
ok so youve told us the query and that you need help  neither of those things are questions whats the question what part are you having trouble with,0
welcome to so what have you tried please show you nonworking code and specify what is the current output and what is your desired output,0
have you considered hiring and paying a programmer,0
i am speechless,0
  google translate formats english in humanreadable format the grammar spacing is generally correct and it capitalises recognised nouns and the first word in a sentence the op may have used it to aid in his translations but he certainly didnt post its raw output,0
this is a terrible question you need to discuss what you are doing and what you are trying to achieve before you post a bunch of code that only says i had class ratetime,0
"from httpstackoverflowcomquestionshowtoask 

do your homework

have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question sharing your research helps everyone tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs this demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself it saves us from reiterating obvious answers and most of all it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer
be specific

if you ask a vague question you’ll get a vague answer but if you give us details and context we can provide a useful answer",0
need more information what are the values of your variables have you turned on errorreporting what error if any is being displayed repeating the title of the question in the actual question itself does not help to answer any of these items,0
we need more information seriously what do you expect us to do gaia,0
  did you not read the question or is it that did you not understand my  point he asked what filesfolders can i safely ignore for inclusion with git the answer to which is any of them how do you know he doesnt want to temporarily ignore everything while he works out his build problem,0
  that just seems like meaningless pedantic semantic wrangling i dont think the artificial context you have concocted has any bearing on the reported question you appear to be wilfully misinterpreting the op,0
you need to format your code in a manner that is humanreadable  one long string is not helpful,0
if you got an answer that does not work unaccept that answer and talk to the people that are active in your question in order to get a working answer polluting the site with multiple identical questions is not the way to go,0
1 for not taking care of your own questionno formatting no explanation,0
dont you want to read an objectivec tutorial before writing an operating system in it,0
this has too much superfluous information in it,0
show your code its almost impossible to help if theres no context for these errors,0
sorry its still entirely unclear a what happens b what you expect to happen also the definition of myreturn may be helpful,0
its due to sloppy coding pure and simple take care when you code line up your braces watch your spelling compile often and fix all complilation errors before adding new code that will prevent these types of errors from happening,0
tbh that is not a good example of multithreading it only shows the technical side not how to use it properly multithreading is not instant win it wont magically accelerate your application,0
how about posting the code you have rather than the tutorial,0
please explain how this answers the question,0
any textbook or tutorial website should be able to do this,0
to closers sure the question might be boderline but its not really asking for code switch statements do confuse some due to the model being computed goto and not multiway selection but hey im biased as a i wrote an answer before the close vote was up ,0
  so if someone comes along can someone explain programming would you also jump in,0
op is talking of switches not switch statement or switch case even in a switch statement there is no plural of switch this is a bad and ambiguous question you can be as generous as you want i will close such question as i assume that even a so newbie can post better question and it is his duty op can come back and increase the quality but because people permaturely answer quality will not be increased and finally the question will get deleted as poor question is that generosity,0
modify how  what have you tried so far  anything,0
