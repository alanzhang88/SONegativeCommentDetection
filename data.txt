__label__0 Why should that code even work? You never call your register function. `Sometimes it work` Bet that ***never*** works if that is the complete code
__label__0 You'll learn a lot more if you do your own homework. I'd suggest starting by paying attention to formatting/indentation.
__label__0 Maybe contact this person http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6806568/error-celsius-cannot-be-resolved-to-a-variable?rq=1 who is doing the same homework question.
__label__0 Why are you using a loop inside your methods? Makes no sense. And why are you declaring scanner inside your method?
__label__0 It is a nonsense. Index is ever belong to order.
__label__0 Google is your friend...
__label__0 This is totally unreliable
__label__0 What effort have you made to research this question yourself?
__label__0 @DougSmith You should take a basic tutorial or text book on [tag:c++] before asking here ...
__label__0 I am willing to sacrifice my 300 points just to downvote you even more.
__label__0 Did you do any research before posting? Does as.numeric() not work?
__label__0 This is Homework used in coursera course "programming in R". It should be deleted from the page.
__label__0 We are not going to debug your 1000 line code dump
__label__0 @Measuring Screenscraping is generally frowned upon, so is making bots, combine the two and you have a recipe for downvotes. Sans an explanation one has to conclude __label__0 you're making a bot to game the game.
__label__0 @Measuring Then too, he's basically asking for someone else to write code for him.
__label__0 If you have questions like this then start reading a quickstarter C/C++ tutorial before trying to solve any kind of problems.
__label__0 hope the 2 upvotes are for the sake of the joke
__label__0 Please read a better `C++` tutorial. You seem to be missing the absolute basics of this language.
__label__0 I love his thinking :). Made my day.
I just threw up a little in my mouth...
Sorry but `-1` for zero effort.
This is not a freelancers portal but Q&A site so read how to ask question etc [here](https://stackoverflow.com/tour)
I want a spaceship! But seriously, this question is lacking effort and understanding. Where is your code, what have you tried?
No detail on what you want to achieve, no clear direction, you havent even tried to ask the right question.
Probably because your question is short, shows no demonstration of effort, and seems to purposely discount the usual solutions that might be the best or only possibilities...
Probably because your question is way too broad and you have not posted the code you currently have. SO is not a 'do my homework' site
In all seriousness, just google search for `css starfield` and see what you get...
Did you study about Time Complexity Calculation before asking the question?
Please perform rudimentary research on questions before posting to StackOverflow. This question could be answered immediately using Google.
Possible starting-point: Any C tutorial, book, standard or the like.
Just try something on your own before asking from another..... This is a lazy post
@ThisaruGuruge: lazy like short-circuit evaluation?
Everything on the computer in any form is indeed "real" and stores somewhere. This is more of a hard-ware question if you want those details, not programming, so I wouldn't ask on StackOverflow
Dollar off! ...
This question appears to be off-topic because it is about philosophy.
I'm guessing part of the reason people downvoted is because of the phrase `If you have a 64-bit program installed on a 32-bit computer/laptop`, which of course is so obviously impossible that it's nonsensical.
That's ridiculous.
-1 for not doing your assignment and get some other people do it for you.
Atleast provide some basics done by you, and a hint that this is an assignment
HAHA! This made my day :o)
Hahahahhahaha this made me laugh for the first time today! :D
@orange Regardless of whether the code is there or not, the question is one of the countless debug-this-code-for-me questions posted every day, with little or any additional information such as results of debugging attempts etc. Really not the kind of thing many people, myself included, think SO should be encouraging.
"the code seems perfectly fine, I'm sure these compiler errors mean nothing".
_"the code seems perfectly fine to me"_ - General rule of thumb, every time you think the compiler is wrong you are.
Go Downvotes! you can reach -10 !! :)
"wow" genious program, that corrects misspelled "exerise" into correct "exercise"
@PeterMiehle I hate to scold, but ["As long as the question is in salvageable English and makes some modicum of sense, it should be edited and improved like any other post."](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/non-english-question-policy/)
@Nick you put much too much afford into a "make my homework for me"-question!
please try not to post duplicate answers. especially not when the answer your copying has been posted years before and your answer adds no more value than the original
I do love doing other peoples homework. Do you?
This question appears to be off-topic because googling "python int" is not too difficult.
@MattDMo That's not a reason to close the question, just to downvote.
This seems fairly straight-forward to Google, or just try with an interpreter. Was there something you thought it did or should do that you found counter-intuitive? Sometimes it helps to let folks know that you thought about something a bit and just where your confusion lies.
You can start by [Googling](https://www.google.com?q=pure+css+slideshow&gws_rd=cr&ei=Ghi5VJXfIIrgywOttIG4Dw#q=pure+css+slideshow).
If this is indeed a homework question, I suggest you find another college where they ask meaningful questions.
Let me guess. You copied the above code from some site but it doesn't do exactly what you need, so you want someone to fix it for you.
While the question is more or less straightforward, and the answer provided so far is correct, this indeed looks like a copypasta for a homework assignment left to the last minute. I find it hard to believe one could have written the code provided and not know how to fix the above problem.
@interjay ya ma niggah. Finding easy way out niggah
@TilakRaj this isn't a discussion forum, it's a Q&A site. Ask an [on-topic question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic).
@TilakRaj 1. That's not a question (both because it's a comment, and doesn't actually contain a specific question). 2. We [don't do *"urgent"*](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/6506). 3. We [don't do *"explanation"*](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/253894/3001761). Learn how this site works, or leave.
And "how to load jquery" in Google didn't help?
There's a new start-up company called Google that can actually search the interwebs for you and give you an answer to this...it isn't a very big or well known company but, give them a shot?
Have you not attended a single class yet? Isn't this something that's covered, you know, in the class materials?
I'm pretty sure that is covered by the MSDN documentation.
I smell homework.....
Don't feel this question is too broad as it is asking what is generics in c++. A simple googling like "angle brackets in c++" could have lead @YumYumYum to a yummy answer. like in this link https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sbh15dya.aspx
You should read a beginners programming book first. It seems like you do not understand the very basics of object oriented programming (or any programming) for that matter.
SO is not a code writing service. At the very least show us your HTML and what JQuery you have tried so far.
This post shows no effort whatsoever in finding solution to your problem.
This question appears to be off-topic because it is about a typo and it serves no use beyond this single situation.
The question is not clear, the value of X is unknown, No information about the error is given. How do you expect us to help you?
No I mean, your question is irrelevant :) Your problem is wrong filename or wrong filename visible in Windows? What is your problem? Is filename ok?
You meant to post this on your blog. Stack Overflow is for **questions**.
This question appears to be off-topic because it is insane.
@user3054967: please use google for that: "mysql table limit rows"
@user3054967: there is a point for that - google something about partitioning and sharding. But **it is** a rocket science
You're asking about general database scaling. Your questions range from entry-level to senior-dba level which is causing a lot of frustrating here. You're not going to learn 5+ years of experience in one question/answer environment. You've pointed out a lot of information that you've pieced together from the internet but it's clear you don't understand all the implications. Start slow and work your way from there.. don't ask ridiculous questions and learn when you're out of your league. That's the best thing you can take away from this question.
Google is your friend -> `How to open a url in a new window`
Why don't you come back when you've done some research and can show us some code?
-1 there are solutions all over google and there's a duplicate right here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726761/javascript-open-in-a-new-window-not-tab?rq=1
possible duplicate of [open a new window inside same page in a small size](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9498621/open-a-new-window-inside-same-page-in-a-small-size)
`"swing does not support sleep,..."` -- but it does allow for Swing Timers which is just as good if not better. `"... nor does it allow you to parse ints in an event listener when the references come from an array."` -- sorry but this is hogwash. You've got a bug in your code. If you need our help, post the code, and let's help you find your bug. Or you can rant. Your choice.
I've tried to clean up the formatting. Now what the OP must do is to debug the parse errors -- to look and see ***exactly*** what each array item holds, if it has an trailing or leading spaces, punctuation or anything else that needs to be trimmed. @FredCarston: you definitely have a bug in **your** code, the parsing issue has ***nothing*** to do with Swing, and your posted code ***is*** helpful. Next time, please follow our advice. You've wasted at lot of time and our patience. Remember please that we are all volunteers.
Please tell me those are dummy names...
RIP naming conventions.
SO isn't a code-writing service... Could you demonstrate that you've at least tried _something_?
Try writing it yourself and folks here will be glad to help if you get stuck.
@PeterMiehle What's the point of giving an answer two an unclear question and then complaining about _comments_ making exactly the assumptions you made for your â€œanswerâ€.
we still do not know the definition of MAN()!
You were HIRED as a web programmer at a company and you can't create a simple form with server-side code to send an email to a pre-defined address?????
I highly doubt your question is a good fit for this website. Please consult: http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask. Being polite also helps.
What have you researched yourself, what exactly don't you understand? As this is a fairly beginner-level question, I assume you're learning from a [good book](http://stackoverflow.com/q/388242/1782465) or tutorial. How was it explained there and what parts of that explanation are unclear?
By searching. And remember, the JVM doesn't know what "vowel" means, you'll have to write the algorithm yourself.
at least try, I can think of a million ways to do this
I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because the question is overly broad and shows no evidence of prior effort.
I like this kind of questions `ASAP`. What you are willing to pay us?
what have you tried so far? stackoverflow is not for finding people to do your work, but to help if you're stuck...
It was a trivial question. Perhaps you can all go down-vote this one too (which has far less effort shown): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1948152/select-last-5-elements-with-jquery :)
Why would you post a response when you're not familiar with the topic?
@jpcamara Why would you post a comment that isn't helpful at all to the question 1.5 years later?
you are paroniac dude, so far i have never downvoted anybody, not just for this question
There are umptillion tutorials on the web that explain how CSS selectors work. -1
Like others would say: RTFM . At least bother to lecture the basics before asking on SO.
@temp table returns more than 200 rows, debugging for values for each row is almost impossible
Debug 200 rows is almost impossible. Almost as hard as formatting a question.
you are totally wrong, sorry
Honestly, the OP does not demonstrate any effort to solve the questions on his own. Usually it is expected to introduce the problem in a clear and concise manner (check), and highlight the difficulties that have prevented from solving the problem himself (not check).
No body will answer this nor will I...You should start reading...for your reference... http://ideone.com/Q7Zsme
Please don't be so ridiculous with your edits. It seems this question was mostly downvoted because of an unnecessary edit chain; just leave it now, will you?
Help with what? You've only introduced your problem. It's like saying: "I'm Maroun, please help"
google it.. you can find alot in stack overflow
This question appears to be off-topic because it is about violating the TOS of a third party site.
I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question is about violating the TOS of a third party site.
I am dead serious. You are saying that the code doesn't look right - so I'm asking what causes your suspicions. The code is syntactically correct, although totally useless.
This question is not what stackoverflow is for. You should ask something that would help you, not something about simple syntax. How could anyone except php creator answer that? If it's correct - it's correct.
You have totally useless stuff with a right syntax, the point that it does not make sense to you is right, but you did not write a code to make sense for the computers / compiler; I bet if they had an option to compile you , they would have thrown a null pointer exception on your brain.
Does Swift have no documentation?
Alright, easy now everybody. I think -13 is more than sufficient.
@hek2mgl I certainly wouldn't do it in production! For a dev box, what does it matter? It's the easiest path to a "reasonable facsimile of production".
I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because a simple attempt to run the code would have yielded the result.
But you can try it for yourself, observe the result, and ask a question *if* the result is different - at which point your question can include the actual result, alongside the reasoning for your expectation. Hint: try reading the documentation for `Integer.parseInt(String)` first.
@JigarPatel a word of warning. If you intend to become a professional programmer, you are going to have to learn to look up documentation. And to run programs if you want to know what happens when you run them. Your mother is not always going to be on hand to spoon-feed you your breakfast.
no minimal research is done here
Assuming this is homework (namespace \_1.\_1.\_28?) please show real effort and don't simply post the assignment. I can't imagine what else the point of this assignment would be except to answer the question you're asking us.
I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be asking about programming as defined by the [help center](http://stackoverflow.com/help).
this is a bad bad answer :/
That first link is really a terrible, terrible introduction to "how to generate a normal distribution". Just awful and wrong. Please don't give it additional traffic by linking it...
NO! Gaussian != RandomNumber * sigma + median. This is COMPLETELY WRONG. (Unless "RandomNumber" is gaussian/normal to start with.)
@kodvin, please remove that Gaussian=RandomNumber*sigma+median equation. It is hurting my eyes.
Why is this the accepted answer? It's factually wrong!
This really stinks for @kodvin. A few downvotes is not a big deal, but because his incorrect answer was selected as the "right" answer, his rep is taking a huge beating.
And the documentation was no help here? I rarely berate people for not Googling, but this would have been solved in 2 seconds by typing your title into a search engine.
"@Martijn Pieters: Removed comment. 
 My point was ""google it before you post here"". It takes me a great deal of effort and research before I post a question, and I'd hope that others at least try, to some extent."
@InterruptedException: absolutely, and thats why this question is getting downvoted this much. A quick Google for 'perl time' gave me the same info that ysth posted. The OP may need to pick up some more research skills first.
Oh, man, this is "cleaner" than anything I can think of :) Just hope some random copy-paster from the interwebz doesn't shoot this directly into their console without looking at it :)
Study your math first, then Java.
This is more a HTML question. And a very silly mistake.
Did you read the code, *at all*?
It's 2014. We can do better than this. :-)
I would delete this answer to avoid the shame haha
Error messages exist for a reason.
@AnkitAbhinav "give me the reason and the solution to solve this problem" I'll give you a downvote instead
@AnkitAbhinav So you're trying to learn c++ on the fly at a _coding event_? o_O
@AS Yo welcome!! and never ask such type of silly questions. It's only making a __JUNK__ in SO.
