Since there is nobody at the last spot, it cannot be mapped, which gives [2, 1, 1, 0]. No matter how many times the people follow this set of dance moves, the first three places remain occupied.

"@Brad So syntatically am I looking at something along the lines of a for loop that goes **(int i = 0; i < size; i++) { if (sport_type[index] == 'insert char here') {print out message} }** with size being a counter variable that I set in main to increment each time a new reservation, and thus an indices of the array is set?",1
You have it. Recommend generalizing the function a bit and passing in `'insert char here'` and a string containing a longer description of the sport as parameters. That way you only have to write one function for all sports.,1
...and don't forget to post the final code here so that others can find it in the future.,1
Compiler warnings sometimes need to be enabled. In Visual Studio open the properties and navigate Configuration Properties ->C/C++->General and play with the Warning Level. In GCC add a -Wall to the command line or play with the GUI of whatever IDE you're using to set the command line for you. You'll have to look that up yourself because there are dozens of them.,1
"And part three, in `input_reservation` the line `sport_type[index] = input_type(sport_type, index);` counts on `input_type` returning the correct value, so currently the code blows itself up by not returning. Ideologically, a function should do only one thing, so input should just take input and hand that input off to someone who knows how best to store it. The simpler a function is, the easier it is to debug. So `char input_type(char sport_type[], int index)` should probably be `char input_type()`, read the user input into a temporary value, test the value and return the value when it's good.",1
"@user4581301 I edited with my current revisions. My program is currently running as far as letting the user enter the desired reservation type and patron age, but is not printing anything when the user enters '2'. I will revise again with the changes you suggested about changing the functions",1

Then which time zone do you want to format in?,1
Neither. Timezone is unknown.,1
"Then `Date` isn't what you want, as that represents an *instant* in time, which only has a local year/month/day/hour/minute/second when you apply a time zone. The same instant has different values in different time zones, and they don't make sense without a time zone. It's like asking for the binary encoding of a string without specifying an encoding...",1
"@JonSkeet no, `Date` represents measure of time. It can mean one instant in one timezone and another instant in another.",1
"@JonSkeet no, it's like asking a distance without specifying an origin. We have `double` type which holds this. Nobody requires to provide units of measurement and origin for doubles. The same should be for date-time.",1
"@Dims: No, it really doesn't `Date` is an instant in time - a number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. It's not since some arbitrary point in time - it has a well-specified origin. The longer you fight against this, the longer you will have problems. *Please* accept it. If you don't believe me, you should read the `java.util.Date` documentation, which starts ""The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision.""",1
Your code is correct. You are also correct that it depends on your JVM's time zone and for the same `Date` object will produce differnt results in different time zones. Exactly therefore you need to specify for which time zone you want the result.,1
"If all you have is a point in absolute time (relative to UNIX timestamp), there is no way to format it without a time zone, because that will display as a different time in different time zones.  Where, and in what format, does your value come from?",1
@SLaks suppose it is in Shire,1
@JonSkeet what are you saying does imply UTC.,1
"@Dims: If you have a timezone, you can specify that timezone and you won't have a problem.",1
@SLaks I have no timezone. I have `HH:MM:SS` from third party source. It's timezone if unknown and may mean different instant than one I get if parse this string.,1
"@JonSkeet see my very simple example code, showing, that `Date` is not instant.",1
"@Slaks it not only format matter, you can also call `getHours()` getter and see the same. `Date()` is JUST NOT AN INSTANCE if you use it's components in any way. And you use it in numerous cases. For example, if you read `Date` from database server by clients all over the world, you will get the same components, but different `getTime()`.",1
"IOW, you _don't_ have an absolute time.  You want https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalTime.html",1
"Your tests don't show what you seem to think it shows. You're parsing it in the system default time zone, and constructing 1970-01-01T00:00:01 *in the system default time zone*. However, I'm done here. You're ignoring both what the documentation says and what someone with considerably experience in date/time work says. You're welcome to do that of course, but you're not going to make any progress. You should follow SLaks advice and use `LocalTime`, as that's what the value you're receiving represents. It doesn't represent an unambiguous instant in time.",1
@JonSkeet and you are ignoring how `Date` is used in numerous libraries and tools. I am done here too.,1
"@SLaks I don't want absolute time, I want relative time.",1
"Then you want `LocalTime` or `LocalDateTime`, as that's precisely what they model.",1
"A `Date` only contains an instant. Whether it contains a *correct* instance, well, if it contains an incorrect one it certainly wouldn’t be the first time. In you so-called(!) proof, it contains an instant of 2 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds before the epoch — which in turn tells me you JVM’s time zone is at an offset of 3 hours from UTC.",1
"Dims, I believe the real answer to your question is: stay away from `java.util.Date`. It confuses you, and there’s no reason why you should want that. Use the newer classes in `java.time` instead, like those @JonSkeet mentions.",1
"_I don't want absolute time, I want relative time._ I think what you are looking for is `Duration` or `Period` from `java.time`. Even so numerous libraries and tools use `Date` doesn't mean it's correct.",1
"@LukasWöhrl, that depends on relative to what. If relative to a time zone, Jon Skeet’s suggestion is better. If relative between two points in time, you are entirely correct.",1
"@LukasWöhrl I agree it is not correct, this is my point. And it is not ""an instant"", but it is dual. Second nature of `Date` appears not in formatting only, but in many cases.",1
"@OleV.V. absolutely, just wanted to throw those into the field, as they haven't mentioned yet. @ Dims This simply shows that time is a **very** complex field. Jon Skeet is an expert there, trust him.",1
"I agree in your view that the `Date` class was designed with a “second nature”. I just meant to say, the state a `Date` object holds is an instant only. The second nature is in constructors, the methods, particularly the many deprecated methods, but also in `toString()`. This design is generally considered poor in retrospect and is one of the reasons new classes were designed twice, first `Calendar` and later all the `java.time` classes.",1
@Dims Assume you have a `Date` object created by expression `new Date(60*1000)`. What is the expected String you want to generate from this?,1
"@OleV.V. according to OOP paradigm, the internals of object is black box; the ""true nature"" of object -- is what you can get from it or set to it by it's methods. You can't say, that some of methods are ""true"" and another methods are ""false"". The matter of fact is that `Date` class has TWO contracts, regardless the number of downvotes and regardless documentation. There are a lot of libraries, that READ datetime and present it in `Date` format for java. In this moment, the contract of ""number of milliseconds from UNIX era"" is violated.",1
@infiniteRefactor in my situation I am receiving date time from another source and it is constructed from parts. And I need to print exactly these parts. Your case is irrelevant.,1
"@Dims If the `Date` is constructed from, say, year, month, day in month, hrs and min and you cannot guess the time zone used when constructing it, there is no way you can fulfil the requirement of printing those parts from the `Date`.",1
"@Dims OK. Assume you have a `Date` object created by expression `new Date(70, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)`. What is the expected String you want to generate from this?",1
"@infiniteRefactor something like `1970-01-01 00:01:00` Order should depend on format, but components should be kept.",1
"@OleV.V. Please, understand, that timezone should not be part of date, because date should measure time, while timezone is a measure for space. We are not storing kilograms, meters, and so on units in double. And whe should not keep timezone in Date.",1
"Your ""Update 4"" only proves that `getHours()` reflects the local time zone, which you are changing.  If one repeatedly evaluates `a+b`, and gets different sums when changing `b`, that doesn't mean that `a` is also changing.",1
"@MattJohnson but this means that `a+b` contains also `b`, but not only `a`.",1
"""Contains"" is the wrong word, but sure, `a+b` *is dependent on* both `a` and `b`, in the same way that the hour returned from `getHours` is dependent on both the instant held by the `Date` object and the local time zone.  That does not mean that the instant changes when you change the time zone, no more than it means that `a` changes when you change `b`.",1
"Also, you say in the sample: ""hours property"".  However, `date.getHours()` is a method, not a property.  Java doesn't have properties in the same way that C# has. [It only has methods.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2963249/634824).  A method that takes as input some outside information cannot be described as [pure](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22395430/634824).  Therefore, what you are observing is simply that the `getHours` method is impure because it takes the system time zone as one of its inputs.",1
"@MattJohnson expression `a+b` namely CONTAINS `b`. You MAY say ""depends on"", but you can't say ""contains"" is wrong. 

I never said instant changes, I only said `Date` contains not only instant and this is true. Date is the same as `a+b` in your excellent example, where `a` is an instant and `b` is timezone.

In terms of Java bean convention, `getHours` is a property getter for property ""hours"". I may rewrite access to this property with any bean library. The fact that getters in Java do not have additional brace level changes nothing.

Of course you may say `getHours` is ""impure"".",1
"I believe that it is finally clear what the problem is here. If class `a` has a method `getData` and this `getData` method is returning `a` internal state (which is an instant) modified by some external value (let's skip the timezone, let's say it's user's screen resolution) does this make `a` an instant or not. And does this imply that `a` stores screen resolution or not.  I believe that this is simply semantics thing - how you define what is an instant? It seems that most people define instant differently from the question's author...",1
@PawelGradecki I understand instant as a point on time dimension. I don't deny `Date` contains instant. I deny it IS an instant. We may say it is IMPURE instant if you wish. The very fact that `Date` has so much depreated methods (and that there are so many alternative implementations) alone proves that `java.util.Date` is both impure and bad design.,1
"Ok I understand what you mean,  but can you refer to the example with screen resolution? If the class with a private instant field would have a `getData` method which would return value based on local screen resolution (or any other environmental data), would that mean that it is not instant? Just want to make sure that I get your instant definition right. I believe that a game changer here would be to provide a definition of an ""instant"" from some trustful source, because the discussion is about instants and nobody posted any definition yet.",1
"@PawelGradecki it depends on whether it is possible to reach instant pure. If the class would have only `getData()` which returns only instant, dirtied with screen resolution, I would say either it is not instant, or some special sort of instant, defined by class designer. I am opened to any definition, but it should not drift.",1

"Of course it runs infinitely. The contents of the loop keep checking the same variables, hoping that their values would somehow magically change, on their own. Of course, C++ doesn't work this way.

Have you tried stepping through the code using a debugger?,1
"`commandInput == ""invReport""` this is not how you compare two strings.",1
You `return` a value from `checkdata()`. That does ***not*** automatically `return` and abort the code in `changemode()`. You're not doing anything with the return value from `checkdata`. You're literally calling `checkdata` and then *unconditionally* call `gotothen`; each and every time.,1

"Haskell's type classes are not a form of object-orientation. They are a form of ad-hoc polymorphism, which you typically also get from object systems. But they do not couple data and methods, which is the hallmark of object-orientation.",1
@sclv They do in fact couple data and methods - the type of the data determines which function (or which part of the function definition if you want to view it that way) is called.,1
that couples the *type* of the data and methods! http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/OOP_vs_type_classes,1
"@sclv is right; Haskell typeclasses are much closer to OOP interfaces than OOP classes, but even that analogy isn't perfect. In fact, the closest thing to OOP classes in Haskell are simply [data types containing functions and monadic actions](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FAQ#I.27m_making_an_RPG._Should_I_define_a_type_for_each_kind_of_monster.2C_and_a_type_class_for_them.3F).",1
"@sclv Yes, and that is characteristic of object oriented languages. Only a minority associate operations with instances at all; in even fewer can that be described as the normal operation of the OO system.",1
"@sclv I dont think this is true (although it is an acceptable ""lie to children"").  If you dont think about the constraint system, typeclasses are just a slightly restricted object system.  In that typeclasses have 1. subtyping 2. implicit self reference 3. replaceable self reference (aka inheritance).  A typeclass is just a (parameterized) abstract class in oop while an instance is just an object that inherits from that abstract class.  With GHC 7.4 and some trickery involving `newtype`, `unsafeCoerce` and implicit parameters this correspondence becomes complete.",1
"I also think that ""couple data and methods"" is really independent from OO.  Consider Go as the example of a language where methods are separate from structs, yet it is very OOP.",1
"On the other hand, the naive view that typeclasses are equivalent to interfaces and that datatypes in Haskell are equivalent to classes in OOP that implement those interfaces is just wrong.  The typeclass system is a layer used for defining classes (in the mathematical sense, aka predicates) over Haskell types.  It just happens to be an Object Oriented layer to for defining predicates over Haskell types.",1
@PhilipJF My answer in no way relies on OO being able to do everything that Haskell type classes can do. It relies on the Haskell type class system being able to do everything that OO can.,1
"@PhilipJF Don't know why I'm responding to this nonsense, but typeclasses don't have subtyping, don't have implicit self reference, and don't have inheritance. The ""Haskell's Overlooked Object System"" paper has a good discussion of why typeclasses don't do the job (and hence what it proposes instead), and I think the O'Haskell paper also motivate the differences quite well. Anyway, implicit parameters are not idiomatic Haskell these days, and unlikely to make it into a standard, and once you start to involve unsafeCoerce then you're clearly off the reservation.",1
"@sclv I'm not sure what either of those papers have to do with my claim.  The class per class encoding is clumsy, I agree. My point is more subtle.  Typeclasses in Haskell are classes over types.  We are all constructivist here, so for us to suppose a type is a member of a typeclass requires some sort of ""evidence object"".  Further, the language provides an automatic theorem proving system in the form of inference and global instances.  My claim is only that the proof language for this logic is OO, and it is helpful for reasoning about Haskell to be aware of this fact.",1
"The ""evidence type"" for membership in `Ord` is a subtype of the evidence type for membership in `Eq`.  Implicit this references and inheritance are what let you declare `m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k"" in the definition of `Monad`.  To simulate this behavior with records requires finding a fix-point (as pointed out by Oleg), which should clue you in something is up.  The reason this shouldn't be surprising is that typeclasses sit on the other-side of the ""expresion problem"" from Abstract Data Types.  From William Cooks work we know that means they are probably objects.",1
"Obviously this object system is a restricted one, but you just need to look at Bruno Oliveira's work to know that is a non-essential aspect (see Scala's implicits).  My point about `unsafeCoerce` is that with some extensions and unsafe features you can actually get your hands on the Objects that bare witness to type-class membership  , and using implicit parameters you can construct arbitrary such instances at runtime (although it relies on the compiler not obeying its documentation).",1
"@PhilipJF the ""evidence type"" for membership in Ord (dictionary, I suppose you mean) isn't a subtype of the evidence type for membership in Eq. It's just that Ord membership implies Eq membership. An ord instance can't ""override"" Eq methods. I have no idea what you're getting at with the monad example -- yes if you encode monads with objects, then the encoding is object-y, but that's because you chose an object-y encoding to begin with! Anyway, this ""evidence type"" doesn't always exist. Other implementations of Haskell, such as JHC, show you can go very far without a dictionary encoding.",1
"@sclv A proof of membership in Ord is a proof of membership in Eq.  ""is a"" is the same thing as subtype.  The Monad example is about inheritance (not subtyping, they are separate) since unless a Monad instance overrides the default definition of `>>` it inherits a general one, but this general one uses `>>=` which is defined virtually.  This is what I was talking about in terms of ""implicit this parameter"" and inheritance.   The point that you dont have direct access to this object system and that it isn't always implemented directly, doesn't really matter.  It explains the semantics.",1
But you can explain the semantics *without* an object system too. Does the fact that I can explain counting with pebbles mean that naturals are a *kind* of collection of pebbles?,1
@sclv An object system is anything that meets certain criteria. You cannot say the same of a collection of pebbles.,1
"that is a good point.  I find that thinking about typeclasses as objects plus a Prolog like theorem prover (where every rule begins with a cute) makes it easier to reason about something rather complicated, and gives me access to a body of literatures and design principles that apply to my problem.  Thinking about C++ templates as a functional language sort of like Haskell makes them easier to reason about also.  I generally try to understand the weird edges of mathematical systems by describing them in terms of axioms I already know.  You dont need ring theory to explain integers.",1
"I want to send the list<int> through TCP, and I've already get the server and client connected. Now, I need send the list<int> data from client to server. I know the method send() is based on char* or char[]. I don't know how to deal with list<int>. Thank you very much",1

"@DrakeGuan: You should change the title of your question to reflect your last comment. What's the difference between pip and setup.py isn't much of a question, it seems like you're actually interested in something a bit more specific.",1
"Sure, Thanks a lot!",1
"@DrakeGuan If you want the behaviour of `pip`, use `pip`.",1
"That's somewhat misleading, though - `pip` does use `setup.py`. I'm sure if you get the right options, or possibly use a wrapper script, it's possible to get the same results with setup.py.",1
"This is incorrect. In most cases, pip does download the package from PyPI, unzip it and run the setup.py script (albeit with some extra options). If you try to have pip install from a tarball for example without a setup.py, you'll get an error saying so.",1
"@ThomasK Sure, but that's not the question - the question is why the one does not give identical results to the other.",1
"@Marcin: Obviously they're not the same program: they have different names. But your answer fails to highlight the connection (one calls the other), or explain how to get `setup.py` to do what the OP wants. So it's technically correct, but not useful. @vartec has provided what the OP was almost certainly looking for.",1
@Marcin: Implying that they're entirely separate when `pip` calls `setup.py` is misleading.,1
"@ThomasK Not really. `pip` probably also uses `list`, but it doesn't follow that they are connected. The question does not ask ""how can I re-implement `pip` myself"".",1
"@Marcin: In the context of installing a package, pip and setup.py are clearly connected.",1
"@ThomasK They may be ""connected"" but the question doesn't ask ""are they connected"" - it asks why they don't have the exact same behaviour, and the answer is because they are not supposed to. That's all there is to it; how they achieve those effects is not relevant.",1
@ThomasK What other answer is there? There is no reason whatsoever to expect them to have the same behaviour. You might as well complain that I haven't dumped the whole code for pip in my answer.,1
@Marcin: Of course you can expect them to have similar behaviour: they both serve to install a Python package. It's different behaviour that needs explanation. As for another answer: @vartec's answer is a good start - providing a single option to `setup.py` makes it behave like `pip`. That's relevant and likely useful.,1
"@ThomasK Why does different behaviour need explanation? `pip` does not advertise that it provides identical behaviour (nor vice versa). In so far as they are supposed to be similar, they are similar: they install a python package. To expect a different explanation is like asking why you and I don't use the same writing style: neither of us has indicated that we would.",1
@Marcin: Different behaviour requires explanation because the question is about the difference in behaviour. Where would humanity be if we never asked how or why?,1
"@Marcin: Almost all code questions could be answered by reading enough source, but asking can give more useful information more quickly. Re different things: see red/blue example above.",1
"@ThomasK The reason why you don't perceive blue and red as exactly the same thing is because they are not exactly the same thing. There is no deeper explanation than that. If you want to inquire into the mechanisms of perception, that is a different question.",1
"@Marcin: In both the OP's question and my red/blue example, saying ""because they're different"" does not convey any information that the asker did not already know. Assuming the question is posed in order to gain information, an answer that does not provide information has no value. A useful answer to the OP's question might discuss how the difference is implemented, or why developers chose different mechanisms. For the red/blue conundrum, a useful answer might cover wavelengths of light, pigments, and colour receptors in the eye.",1
"@Marcin: The details of the way that the programme/eye works can be informative and interesting. Given that the question is asked to gain information, if the literal answer to the question contains no information, we can infer that we have misunderstood what the asker wants. In that case, we can attempt to infer the question they meant to ask, and provide useful information. This process does not always work perfectly, but it's better than an answer with no information.",1
"@ThomasK You may doubt your powers of comprehension, but I am confident in my own. When someone asks a nonsensical question, I assume they don't know that what they are asking is nonsensical, rather than inferring that it is an oblique way of soliciting a general disquisition on the topics mentioned. In that case, informing them that their question is nonsensical is new information.",1
"@Marcin: No, the question can be clearly understood to have a rational answer, more specific than a general discussion. Possible readings are ""how can I make them behave in the same way"" (which vartec answered), ""how do they achieve different results"" (similar), or ""why did the developers choose different mechanisms?"" (we can presume the `pip` developers were aware of the other mechanism).",1
"@ThomasK Leave the votes of others out of it - you are still arguing that I should make up a new question. If you want this to be a different question, go ahead and edit it.",1
"@Marcin: The votes of others became relevant when the discussion moved to what SO is about. In as much as SO is a community, what it is about is determined by the opinions of its members.",1
"@ThomasK Well, if you really want to argue about that, it turns out that SO users don't have to leave a reasoned explanation for their downvotes. For example, I am getting a bunch of downvotes on old questions, which I assume come from you (for obvious reasons) and vartec (whenever he sees my handle he is reminded that I once pointed out an error in one of his answers). So no, they don't really convey much information.",1
"@Marcin: I have not gone back to downvote your other answers, and I do not intend to.",1
@ThomasK Perhaps vartec is feeling extra insecure today.,1

"I **will** downvote any answer that is clearly wrong. @Marcin: if you can name any of your **correct** answers that I've allegedly downvoted, don't be shy, mention it.",1
"@vartec You know that I can't tell who is downvoting my answers, especially as you never leave comments. One presumes that is because you have no valid criticisms.",1

"Andrew, please check WickedFan's correctly referenced linked from MSDN. Points are represented as POINT(lat,long,SRID). Consider a case where data needs to be converted from geography to geometry. There are several ways of doing this. One of which is to use STAsText which produces the text Point(lat,long) etc. This will NOT work. As the geography version creates the wrong text but the geometry insertion expected Point(x,y) etc. This method also allows for change of projection.",1
"Damien_The_Unbeliever, please check the example i gave and my reply to Andrew. WickedFan also correctly provided the reference to MSDN documentation of the definition of POINT. In this case i am trying to convert large amount of data from geography to geometry and change the projection at the same time. Hence the reason for using STAasText and not the binary version. STAasText for geography should return the value of POINT as per definition on MSDN.",1

Where on the globe do you think that this point is located? The convention in WKT is `long lat`, not `lat long`. This is different from the convention you may have expected but it's *not* a bug.

"i already write a tons of ideas. First making a list and join the spliting , i get something like ['A1','A10'] but i cannot access to A or 1. After maybe using the string and using their access but i get confused to check EX my string can be
A1 A10
B14 B10

How i can check if after the letter , have 2 or 1 number?

errors are clearly shown in the error stack !,1
i know they're telling me the erros. but these errors simply don't exist.,1
You need to define the `enum` first and then use them in the function declaration. You have reversed the order.,1

"Unfortunately, though compilers are very good at assembling machine code from well-formed source code, they are remarkably bad at assembling error-messages.  All of them are bad, (and linkers worse:).  One syntax error can generate pages of utter rubbish as the compiler digs itself an ever-bigger hole. Often, the only thing you can do is look at the first line flagged as erroneous, carefully examine it and 'mess about' until you find out what is really causing the problem, (eg. using enums before declaring them).",1

"if you had to enter the number of children you plan to have, do you think you need decimals there, or will a natural number (no decimals) suffice ? Next to this, there are performance reasons.",1
Floats and doubles also have a lot of precision problems that integers do not have.,1
"In addition to Stultuske's comment, floating point arithmetics are a bit of a nightmare",1
"Some of the bits in floating point numbers are used for an exponent, so the range of integer values of a float (which is 32 bits) is smaller than the range of an int (32 bits). For instance, [this link](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/flintmax.html) says that the largest consecutive integer in IEEE single precision is 16777216 (2^24), which is far smaller than the largest integer in an equivalent integer type,  2147483647 (2^31 - 1)",1
@Stultuske realy good example,1
"*""You can keep any integer number in a variable of type double.""*--try to compare `(double)5_000_000_000_000L` and `(double)4_999_999_999_999L` to see why you're wrong.",1

"I think it returns the expected result, but maybe not the desired result. :) So I assume your problem is the comments outside the html elements.",1
I understand the answer is unhelpful (especially since the question is also tagged C++). However by providing the length of the string in another variable you effectively make zero-terminated strings capable of everyhting length-prefixed strings are capable of with the same performance.,1
At that point it's not a null terminated string. It's a string prefixed by a length. And good luck passing that thing around.,1

Add a space in the macro. Eg: `#define operator-10` --> `#define operator -10` and do the same for the other macros,1
The compiler gives you the line no: with error description(quite sufficient to understand),1
please consistently indent the code for readability by us humans.  Suggest 4 spaces after every opening brace: '{' and un-indent before every closing brace: '}',1
"the compiler is telling you exactly what line the error (usually syntax error) is on AND what the error is.   Suggest enabling line number on your editor, go to the indicated line, fix the syntax/spelling/whatever.",1
white space between tokens is (almost) always necessary.  white space between code blocks makes code much easier for us humans to read.,1
"regarding this line: 'return(symbol=='\0'||symbol==' '||symbol=='\t');' '\0' is not normally considered a white space characters.  However, '\n' is considered white space.",1
"always indent with spaces, not tabs.   This is because tabs are not a consistent width.  The actual width depends on the settings of the individual word processor or editor",1

What are you trying to do with this `Console.WriteLine(nbOccurences);`?,1
"it looks like you want to return the value of `m`. You should do that by making `nbOccurrences` `public int nbOccurrences` and `return m;` at the end. Then, assign the result by doing `int occurences = n1.nbOccurrences(test123, chiffrebase);`. Finally, do `Console.WriteLine(occurrences);`. The problem is that your method has no output, so it can't give anything to the `WriteLine` function that will be sent to the console (how does it know what to put there?). And also, `nbOccurrences` by itself doesn't *run* the function, just names it.",1

The point is your example does not justify the mechanism when sensible design using basic mechanisms of the language suffice in your example situation.  More generally perhaps C++ exception handling is what you need.,1
"@Clifford - yes it is just an example, its point is to illustrate what I want to achieve, not how it makes sense in actual code. Unfortunately, I cannot use C++.",1
You are reinventing `longjmp` if you want that to be portable and general (and compatible with recursive functions),1
"@BasileStarynkevitch - well, not all of our systems come with a spare 150 gigs of ram to afford to be reasonable with a billion `longjmp`s.",1
"A billion `longjmp`  will generally use a constant memory space of a hundred bytes. They won't even spend a single megabyte, and the billion calls to `longjmp` will require a few seconds in total, each of them lasting a few dozens of nanoseconds...",1
@BasileStarynkevitch - somehow and amazingly so you are STILL missing the point that it is about error handling and achieving in practice stack unwingding. So those billion jumps will require a billion buffers. In fact the buffers will end up being there even if no jumps are made. So to my question about zero cost error handling you are answering with a solution with an impossible cost.,1
"No, my improved answer show that there is no billion buffer in heap, only one single `jmp_buf`  *temporarily* on the call stack.",1
"So how do you trace back your N > 1 number of steps with only one jump buffer? Nobody is talking about heap, but the deeper you go, the more buffers you leave behind so you can make the jump if you have to. You can at best limit it to one buffer for each stack frame, reusing the same buffer if there are more than one error prone operations per frame.",1
"Please read more about `longjmp`. It can unwind dozens of thousands of call frames in constant time, and most call stacks don't have that much. A typical call stack cannot exceed a few megabytes on most laptops",1
"I am well aware of the typical stack sizes, but even though the stack as a memory buffer is a flat object, what happens inside has a tree structure. Storing a jump buffer on every frame in a deep call chain will run out of stack space in no time. Since even if the buffer only stores a few registers, it is still a constant size construct. Might have been nice if the compiler actually trimmed it down to only what is needed to store a particular state.",1
"See my example. You don't store a `jmp_buf` in most call frames, only in some initial ones.",1
"As a caution: let's keep this discussion civil, and avoid pointed comments about other users.",1
"@BasileStarynkevitch if you don't store each of the steps then the stack unwinding will not collect all the objects in between, it will all leak, which is why your solution is utterly useless. The goal is not to get back to where you started, it is to do so AND properly collect all objects along the call stack. This will require a LOT of jump buffers and will result in massive CPU and MEMORY OVERHEAD.",1
you could provide the code you have already written and point out where you are struggeling. This would make it more likely that you´ll be getting an answer.,1
"You'll do better here if you post code and ask questions about specific difficulties.  This isn't a ""haz the codez"" site.",1

"how do you imagine a situation that it fails? Except when a null pointer is passed, otherwise it's just a comparison that returns how the strings compares",1
It will fail if the strings aren't null terminated?,1
"The only ways `strcmp()` can fail are if you pass one or two null pointers, or if the 'strings' are not properly null terminated (but they need to be similar chunks of data because `strcmp()` stops as soon as there's a difference).   However, that invokes undefined behaviour so anything can happen and it is valid.",1
Do you understand the difference between a keyword and a function call?,1
"yes, I understand, what i wanna know is how compiler handles int, char etc ?",1
"A fundamental type is not a function. It does not need to be declared. It's fundamental. Nor do basic keywords need to be declared. How would you declare such things, without using... basic keywords?",1
"With all due respect, no, you don't. Please read a basic C book first.",1
"The compiler knows how to handle basic types and keywords because their behaviour is specified by the Standard and the compiler must implement this behaviour using whichever resources are available on the architecture used for compilation. This is circular logic. The compiler must know how to do such basic things, otherwise it... couldn't compile.",1
thats what i wanna know ? how the compiler knows ?,1
Are you asking about how a compiler knows the spec for the supported language?,1
"`printf` is not _defined_ in a header, but only _declared_!",1
"languages have grammar, constructs, (sometimes) types, and keywords. Functions are build using these things that make up a language. `printf` is a function. `return` is a keyword. `int` and `char` are types. The basic format of a function is defined by the grammar (ie `return_type name (args) { function body }`. Compiling an expression like `int a` doesn't call a function, it's simply using the language. `printf()` is invoking a function. If the compiler doesn't know about that function, there's a problem. It's pretty obvious, isn't it?",1
@user123456987: A compiler is just another program; it reads input (your code) and processes it according to a set of built-in rules.  It recognizes keywords like `int` and `char` and `return` because it was *written* to recognize those things.,1
This example does not show any use of exception filters.,1
This is standard way to filter exception in c#6.0,1
Take a look again at what exactly exception filters are. You are not using an exception filter in your example. There's a proper example in [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22864936/247702) posted a year before yours.,1

"It is a reasonable thing to argue that the standard is broken regarding this being allowed to be null for non-vcalls (I don't necessarily agree but that's a fine opinion to hold). For other optimizations (e.g. the ""Felix-gcc"" one) it is very hard to teach a compiler what is OK to optimize and what a human intended. That is architecturally very unclean and might be practically impossible. Linus Torvalds has made the same error once about an optimized out NULL check.",1
"'pretty much every real-world program is undefined' - not sure what is the basis of this claim. The systems I work with do not rely on undefined behaviour, and when such is discovered (because people make mistakes), it is treated as bug and fixed, rather than blaming it on the compiler.",1
@Ben you can turn on that behavior using a switch and I would not condemn you for doing that. I find the idea of safer versions of C and C++ very useful. But it costs your performance in certain loops. C generally is a language that is supposed to be so close to the metal that there is not enough room below C and above assembler for another language.,1
"@boot4life The problem with a switch is it is old code which needs that behaviour, that is the code where by definition the makefile does not have the switch because it did not exist when the code was written.",1
"@boot4life, actually those who argue against this kind of optimization want semantics which are closer to ""the metal"".",1

"@hvd, no it isn't. Common practice is to use the latest compiler for each new release. I'm glad you version-control your compiler and BDIFF the different versions looking for breaking changes in the compiled output before upgrading, but most people just don't.",1
"@Ben You've read my comment just barely enough to type up a response to it, but clearly not nearly enough to understand what I wrote. You were saying that for pre-existing code, there is no way that their Makefiles specify any options needed to make it work that did not exist at the time. I'm saying that those Makefiles do typically specify that the user can provide custom options. Your response to that totally misses my point. It's not about how many developers / users make use of that ability, it's merely about the ability being there, when you say it's not.",1
"@hvd, I understand that the user can ""specify options needed to make it work"", and for an automated build system, you can set these options as a global default. I get it. My point is that by default **there is no reason for them to believe that there is any need for them to do it**. There are no new warnings produced, it just compiles. How can they know that actually there is a breaking change there? They don't read the compiler release notes, **they assume the compiler writer is on their side**. Unfortunately it seems **he is not**. Breaking changes need to be opt-in not opt-out.",1
"Step number one in writing robust correct code is to know your tools.

"Reformulated without the sarcasm and with background information, this answer would be more useful than it is. As written it's unlikely to reach its target audience. In particular, if you don't know *why* disabling the certificate check is bad and what the exact impact is of doing it anyway, you have no standing to go to anyone else and berate them for their SSL practices, so that advice is not useful.

Looks pretty much defined to me.,1
*What will be the length of array containing n numbers [...]* Well... `n`?,1
`n` elements or `a.length` elements.,1
n. Arrays are of a fixed size.,1
"If the size of an array is [_undefined_](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/undefined), you cannot get it, because it is **undefined**. However, your array very well has a [_defined_](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/defined) length. Oh, and: please learn about the [`sizeof`](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#6.5.3.4p2) and array and its length (i.e. number of elements).",1

"@FredK: Me too:-) But as given, it can be any, so OP should clarify once he actually knows what he is asking. But that seems to be another fire-and-forget question.",1
"After all the jesting I can inform that `printf(""Array a length is %d\n"", sizeof a / sizeof a[0]);` will do the job, at least in C. It's exactly the same with `b` but note that I changed the narrative from ""size"" to ""length"". Having said that, my puzzlement about the comment *`Size of the array may change adding/deleting elements`* turned to wonder, even mirth, since it is a fixed size array ;). How can you possibly keep track of its usage without another variable holding that information?",1

@VincentSavard `std::wstring` then?,1
@AlgirdasPreidžius There is no built in support for Unicode in C++.  Even the higher width character strings are problematic.  If you need unicode in C++ it is best to use a library.,1
@VincentSavard: In what way does `std::string` not support unicode?,1
@NathanOliver [libiconv](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Generic-Charset-Conversion.html#Generic-Charset-Conversion) does a pretty good job when character conversion is necessary.,1

"@VincentSavard: Okay. I thought you were referring to the often repeated confusion that you need a wide character string to store unicode.

It should still contain all items of repeating sequence,1
"When you say ""shortest common subsequence (NOT SUBSTRING)"", what is the distinction you're trying to make? And the next phrase, ""contains all the items in the subsequence"", makes it sound like you're talking about a subset (ignoring order), not a subsequence. So… can you define exactly what you're looking for?",1
"Also, if `[255, 7, 0, 0]` is in a ""subsequence"" in your sense of `[255, 5, 6, 7, 0]`, why isn't `[255]` also a ""subsequence"", and an obviously shorter one?",1
"Finally, ""I tried longest common subsequence""… Why did you try that? Getting the longest common subsequence obviously isn't going to do the right thing if you want the shortest common subsequence. If you can explain the thought process that made you think LCS would be helpful, it might help us understand the problem. (For comparison, imagine you wanted to find `min`, and you knew how to find `max`. You might try to negate all the numbers, find the `max`, then negate it, but get stuck somewhere on the way. Did you think you were on the track for a similar solution to get SCS from LCS?)",1

Have a look at my answer's second paragraph: don't use `a[i] == s` but `a[i].equals(s)` instead. `==` will require the objects to be exactly the same instances which is not true in your case because you have a literal and a string instance created from input.

"Before I make my answer, are you puzzled only about the vector part, or is that for loop confusing you, as well?",1
Actually both. Loop is something where I dont know which index program in accessing by using idx and in vector related loop I have tried to colour the Image but Its dead slow. Its like 10 pixels in one second. So I wonder if I was doing the right thing or not. As you can see the commented code. This commented sections are basically my understanding regarding that CPP code.,1
"From what I just read, Whatershed gives you an image with marker for each pixel, it's basically numbers identifying blobs, it's the ""marker"" mat. 

To color the output they use a Look Up Table (LUT) giving the color you should apply given the maker number, that's the part : 
wshed.at<Vec3b>(i,j) = colorTab[index - 1];

Was that the answer you were looking for?

try looking at MSDN on the DateTime for examples of what other properties you can access.. this pretty straight forward in regards to the documentation,1
"Explain why you ""really need it"". Explain what you need it for. You have an XY problem, X being why you need this and Y being ""I know, I'll use a DateTime without time"". The latter is impossible, a DateTime _always_ has a time part, so please explain your original problem X and I'm sure there's an easier solution. Perhaps `DateTime.ToString(string format)` will do what you want.",1
What is wrong with `DateTime dt = DateTime.Now.Date`?,1
"Its because of how `DateTime` is stored in memory. Its the number of ticks (100-nanosecond units) since the `DateTime` epoch, which is January 1, 0001 at 00:00:00.000. Since the underlying value is actually a time, the value is always itself a time.",1
Do you just want `Date dt = date.Date`?,1
yes i want dt hold only Date not datetime,1
"Again, you can't. Explain why you want that.",1
"then do something like this it's so simple 
`var date = DateTime.Now.Date;
 var dt = date.ToShortDateString();` return what you are looking for as a String",1
@CodeCaster what are you talking about it returns the Date only he doesn't want the time..,1
"@MethodMan OP is asking for a DateTime. You give them a string. That may be what they need, but it isn't what they're asking for.",1
I know what he's asking for the problem is the OP doesn't understand the DateTime Structure ...,1
Why are you using `byte b = a.Length`? Why didn't you use `int b` or `var b`?,1
Are you saying that Visual Studio shows the length as 0x0A when you hover over `a.Length` in the editor?,1
"Your code does not even compile. I changed it to byte[] a = { 0x0A, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x09, 0x01 };
            int b = a.Length; and it returns b = 10 as expected.",1
"Are you sure this is C#? Array declaration (`[]`) must be placed after the type (`byte`), not the identifier (`a`). This isn't C...",1
"How did you even compile that?
you should declare array as `byte[] a`, and you can't just assign `int` to `byte`",1
"There are either too many possible answers, or good answers would be too long for this format. Please add details to narrow the answer set or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphs.I would suggest that you find a development forum (perhaps [quora](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming)?) to work out generalities. Then, when you have specific coding issues, come back to StackOverflow and we'll be glad to help.",1
"please give us your attempts at completing this task, we are not your personal team of programmers.",1
What does your array look like?,1
"But think this: If the method is not allow to create parent, if parent not exists? does it throw an exception?",1
Please add at the very least - add examples of the parent directories youb claim are being created. You could use your watch program to advise you.,1
"A small combination of [`Directory.GetParent`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directory.getparent(v=vs.110).aspx), and [`Directory.Exists`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directory.exists(v=vs.110).aspx) should be trivial to implement.",1
"no, this is imprecise since no parents need exist EG: folder `C:\test` exists and `C:\test\this\is\the\folder\to\make` does not exist there is no other way then recursively walking up that long path checking each time because those paths, none of them exist, THEN making them one at a time BEFORE then doing that final check you mention. I am asking if there is an easier way to TRY to make it then recursion only if it fails",1
"Not to my knowledge, but it should be easy to make one using the two functions I highlighted.  There is no need for recursion, just get the parent of the one you want to create.  If the parent exists, call `Directory.CreateDirectory`.  If it doesn't, don't call it - then it won't create all the missing ones.  If that isn't what you need, please edit your question for more clarity.",1

"it's not easier, because I have to do it in reverse because of the manual temporary `opt out` has to be sent in the correct order to send to the watcher to stop it `watching` , additionally the directory ALWAYS does not exist",1
"How does a watcher and an opt out concept all of a sudden come into the picture? You don't mention them anywhere in your question, and to be honest, I don't understand your last comment at all. Please be more precise.",1
"without the ""mode"" I asked for in the OP the only way is to do `reverse recursion` over the non existent paths i.e in order of the shortest path NOT the longest path, (which is normal in normal recursion), it is highly sub optimal when a simple flag could have accomplished it",1
"The more comments I read, the less I understand the question. Perhaps you want to solve your original problem (you mentioned something with *watch program* and *berserk*), **not** your attempt to solve it (doing something weird with `CreateDirectory`)?",1
a google search lead to this - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5767605/looping-through-regex-matches,1
"@ZivWeissman: That is a different question. This question is about producing every possible match, not about iterating over the matches in a given input.",1
"Even if you eliminated special characters, there are 96 trillion 8 character combinations, 5,416 trillion 9 character combinations, etc. If you were able to go through 1,000 combos a second, it would take you tens of thousands of years to go through just the 8 character ones.",1
@DavidDeutsch Maybe I could narrow it down to expressions that contain real words in the dictionary?,1
"There's https://code.google.com/p/xeger/ - generates a matching input for a regex. This problem, however, is not trivial, as it's entirely possible to create a regex that matches any input or that doesn't match any input.",1
"@PeterThiel: That would change the question quite a bit, wouldn't it? You can't produce a REGEX that says ""contains real words in the dictionary."" There are plenty of tools out there that use dictionaries, and transformations on the words in those dictionaries, to attempt brute-force attacks like this. Is there a reason you're not using one of those? Is this just an intellectual exercise?",1
if hacking to account was that easy then nothing was safe!,1
"From the fact that there is a digit, a ""special"" character and a captial, we can deduce that those are all allowed, as are lower case letters. Let's assume this is relatively insecure; doesn't allow any others and only has 5 ""special"" characters allowed. For the minimum size of 8 characters there are 5×10×26×5⁶⁷ = 8.809142651×10⁴⁹ possibilities (more, I'm assuming the same order). If we can manage a billion tries a second, then that'd take 2.791448859×10³³ years. That's 2.023082229×10⁴¹ times longer than the universe has been around. Implementing the brute-force efficiently is not the problem.",1
Also if it's over the web it doesn't have to be efficient; even a slow algorithm producing passwords to try will have raced ahead of the actual attempts.,1

"If you were expecting a `Date` object with a certain format, then that's not going to work. A `Date` object does not have a format. You cannot get a `Date` object that knows by itself to print in a certain format; the `Date` object does not remember its format.",1
`sizeof` works just fine with C++ types.,1
Right. That's how you would do that. Looks like you know exactly how to write such a template.,1
@PeteBecker sizeof will most of the time return the container implementation.,1
@SamVarshavchik I think Brian has a better idea than both of us.,1
"@areuz -- yes, that's what `sizeof` does: it gives you the size of the object. If you want to do something else you need to say what you want to do.",1
"@Stefan, you're likely receiving downvotes because the solution cannot use hard-coded collections.",1

"S3 **is** ""at least a little server"". What you can't do is to load it from a `file:///...` url from your local disc because of browser security constraints (at least not with additional command line parameters).

Thank you for clarification @GünterZöchbauer,1

Do you want to get a list of all object's method? If yes then `__dir__()` is useful.,1

What are you trying to do ?,1
"@AliGajani, the question says what I'm trying to do.",1
Sorry but please elaborate..with  an example..,1
"@AliGajani, that all is in my question: find an element and modify it.",1
There are no lists in that code.,1
"@IanAuld, take another look.",1
`int number = (int)deltaTime;`...,1
@Trobbins I was mislead by the title of the question.,1
You mean use \Redirect;,1
This is not a complete answer.,1
at the top of which file? the solution is incomplete and confusing.,1
Your file `arial.ttf` is in the same location from where you are executing the program if not could your try giving the entire path. `Access violation reading location 0x74742E6C.` means location you are trying to read does not exist,1
"@VinayShukla It is where it is supposed to be, I have tried using `if(!font.loadFromFile(""Higher Or Lower\Arial""))` but it does not work http://imgur.com/yEVSb5g",1
The address of the access violation `0x74742E6C` happens to be be the hex representation of `'l.tt'` i.e the characters at offsets 4-7 from your font name.  This is almost certainly due to a mismatch between debug & release compiled files.  That fact it works in `release` but not `debug` suggests that you are using the `release` library with your `debug` build.,1
"This is (forgive me for saying it) a ""_stupid_"" constraint, and I don't see what is the benefit in acheiving it. Also, `main()` without a return type is very old syntax.",1
"Which is it, C, C++ or Java? These require quite fundamentally different solutions to the problem.",1
It is absolutely not clear to me what you are trying to do. You cannot ignore the syntax rules in any of these programming languages. What are you trying to achieve? Develop a parser?,1
"I didn't got it, what're you trying to do? Apply operations `+`, `-`, `*` to all of the `0…99` numbers? And which numbers? Is it like `0+1+2+3…99`? Or what?",1
Can you write the expression in math?,1
"By the way, if you are going to use a `scanf()` return value, use it right `if (scanf('%d"", &n) == 1)` is the correct syntax, and you can't declare a variable in the `if` statement condition.",1

"@iharob the title mention three languages ☺ But okay, I got you.",1
"@Hi-Angel: The accepted answer implies en exclusive-or for _definition_ _or_ expression. For this question, it would result in the expression after the `=` being the initializer. I do not see much sense in `0 && <expression>` either. Which might be the problem (for C++).",1
"@Olaf sorry, but I didn't get you ☹ In the answer no `xor`, and I don't see the `0 && <expression>`. I assume that you meant the code `int n=0 && scanf(""%d"",&n) …` inside the question, then it isn't what you thought — the idea is that the variable `n` being declared without a semicolon, which is a constraint of the puzzle.",1
"This can be done in Java if needed in a different manner than what is mentioned in answer below. - hope they are not asking these at interviews these days. Anyway question is closed, so answer.",1

For the reset: It is very well what I thought. And: I can read.",1
"@Olaf I still couldn't get you, but I'll try to answer. «*The accepted answer implies either definition or expression.*» → The answer uses a hack that allows to write *any* code that would use semicolon; i.e. allows both definition and expression. «*For this question, it would result in the expression after the = being the initializer for `n`*» → as I see OP wanted to declare a varible, then use it in expression. I.e. if we couldn't write an expression or definition, an answer would be impossible.",1
"«*I do not see much sense in `0 && <whatever expression>` either*» → No, it is not just zero in the code on the left side! It is a variable declaration, and the declared variable being used next on the right side.",1
"@Hi-Angel: So it would not work. Read the accepted answer to the question you inked **again**: It is _either_ a declaration, _or_ an expression. For here, the **whole** part right of `=`  is the initializer! And as boolean opeartors uses **short-circuit evaluation**, only the `0` part is actually evaluated and assigned to `n`! **This is what happens**. So, consider, the first term was not `0`. The the `scanf()` would be evaluated, changing `n`.However finally, the whole result of the boolean expression would be used to initialize `n`, overwriting the value from `scanf()`.",1
"@Olaf ahhh, now I see! ☺ So, you meant the accepted answer in the link, not the one here as I thought. Okay, so, for the first everything inside of if-statement being evaluated in an order. I.e. the `n` indeed would hold zero, then accept a number of user, next print it. As about a zero… Well, here it is `if (int n = 0 && scanf(""%d"",&n) && printf(""%d\n"",n)) {} else if(scanf(""%d"",&n) && printf(""%d\n"",n)) {}`.

"@Hi-Angel: Have a look at [operator preceedence](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence).

However, that is still not ideal, as the rest of the `if` condition after th `0` ist actually just decoration and never executed for the reasons I gave already.

"@Olaf yes, it is better, and it works too, I checked ☺",1
"@Hi-Angel: I know it does (thought you might get the idea yourself actually:-) Still, this is just a stupid (without the `""`) constraint. Just leads to writing unreadable code wihout any gain in knowledge.",1
Have you given it any thought yourself yet? How many times is the function executed for `n` being 0 or 1? How many times for `n` being 2? Can you extrapolate from there how many times it'd be executed for any given `n`? How much memory is used per call?,1
I have given it so thought but i don't understand how to get answer. The run time complexity is 2^n and so would the memory be the same?,1
@Zero Where did you get O(2^n)? That is not correct,1
"Since you're asking for the memory consumption: how much memory is stored in each scope? There's only one local variable (the argument) so that is O?? Once you know that, how deep does the callstack go given that you know n is decremented by 1 each time and the recursion stops when you reach 0? Integrate the amount of memory in each scope along the number of scopes (callstack depth) and you have your answer.",1

"Tongue-in-cheek answer: if you don't want to use `intVec.push_back(x)`, use `intVec.insert(intVec.end(), x)` instead. More seriously: you need to either pre-initialise the vector to a size, or add elements to it, if you want it to not be empty.",1

"After edit: That's not possible. `std::vector::operator[]` can only access existing elements, it never changes the vector's size.",1
If you want the size to be 1 after `intVec[0] = 1;` it also has to be 1 before `intVec[0] = 1;` -  there's no way around that. You can `intVec.resize(1)` first if you're desparate for the indexing operator.,1
@user1056903 _he size of the vector should be 1 after `intVec[0] = 1`_ No. What makes you think so? I'd recommend you first consult the [reference documentation](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/operator_at) before making wild assumptions.,1

If you add a scrollview to the root of this layout, then you can scroll the form to view all fields, else you cant.

The question is how to do this at run time with varying width content,1
so.... what have you tried?,1
Why would you want this?,1
Take a look at the Javascript `navigator` object,1
The problem with this solution is that it would replace any other styles in the `style` attribute instead of just changing/adding the `width` property.,1

What do you intend for that line to do?,1
What exactly does `int object.getSpawn().setUse(false);` mean?,1
"When you make an error like that the compiler tries to make sense of it.  The first attempt is probably to consider `int object` as a declaration.  It would then observe that there is no semicolon after that ""declaration"".  Hence the error message.",1

"You seem to be confusing ""the address of a thing"" and ""the address of a different thing"". The address of *any* object `x` is always `&x`. That's also true for arrays. But *additionally* the array expression itself decays into a pointer -- but a different kind of pointer! It decays into the pointer to the *first element*. That's a  different animal from the array itself. So both `arr` and `&arr` exist and make sense, they're just different things.",1

It's to loop through the array one element at a time. An array is a data-structure of index(es) with values in it from some data-type (in this example it's objects).  The objects can only be accessed by evaluating the elements in the index of the array. The loop is the structure that achieves this.,1

I believe that's because you never initialize the array properly.,1
"In order that we can help you effectively, you should give us as little code possible (see http://sscce.org/) and describe your problem as much as possible (i.e. give all error messages, not just ""it doesn't run""). Also, to ask questions like ""here's my code, find a bug for me"" is not very good.",1
"*""If any error occurs then...""* Then what? getInstance() will throw an exception. What exactly is the behavior you expect?",1
AFAIK the best way to implement a singleton in Java is through an `enum`. See [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/71399/1825094).,1
"If you consider `enum` hacky, the [Spring framework](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) has set up singletons for years.",1
"Is it me, or are you checking one condition two times in a row without doing anything?",1
2 things: 1: your instance does not need to be volatile. 2: you can synchronize the getInstance() method and lose the synchronized block within. Only check for null once.,1
@NickJ Making the method synchronized would potentially create a fairly large performance hit if many calls are made to getInstance() simultaneously.  Declaring the instance as volatile is also importance and Java's memory model does not handle double-checked locking well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking#Usage_in_Java,1
"I am aware that enclosing too much in synchronized blocks is a performance hit, but I stand by my comment because by far the most expensive operation in `getInstance()` is creating the instance, which would need to be synchronized anyway. Checking the existance if relative cheap, and also needs to be in the same synchronised block, so you may as well just synchronize the method. Volatile is unnecessary because `uniqueInstance' is only ever accessed from the same synchronized block.",1
But note that this is almost certainly a bad idea. You're going to totally mess up various overloaded function calls. Prefer to define `operator<<` for `std::ostream&` and `MyInteger`.,1
@ Lightness Races in Orbit I do not think so because as I have understood this class emulates integral numbers. So it also can be used in arithmetic operations. Moreover I gave direct answer to the question. There is no question what is better.,1
"It may emulate integral numbers, but it is not one. It is a class type. Implicit conversions — particularly to built-in types — are _evil_! Sometimes a direct answer is harmful. Of course in this case it's hard to tell what the real use case is since this particularly example is so contrived and does nothing but wrap `int`.",1
@Lightness Races in Orbit You are trying to discuss totally another question.,1
You can talk! The question asks for an `operator=` and you give him a conversion operator. We're both looking for his _actual_ problem and trying to give an _actual_ solution.,1
@Lightness Races in Orbit I gave an actual solution. I did not answer the question what approach is better because I even do not know how the class is defined. It is not my task to design the class. Your reasoning is simply stupid because for example its class can be a functor used for example in std::for_each algorithm and the best and simple way to get value is to use the conversion operator. Please stop trolling.,1
"You could refactor the object instantiation and `Start` invocation into a new method on a static helper class, and the `Stop` and `Trace` calls as well. But, really, is this so offensive? IMHO this is hardly *verbose*.",1
"FWIW, you could use `var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew()` and save a line.",1

I'm seen a lot of inconsistency (and sometimes downright incorrect code) in apps I've worked on, so I'd really like to *just do in right, once*. A static helper method sounds like the right path to take here.",1
"This is impossible, with all your arbitrary conditions like ""no width specified on items."" It may be helpful to provide the code you have already tried... and why you want these conditions... instead of giving us some specification and saying ""write my code for me.""",1

"@Samy447, one of the first things that I would check is whether the result of your get call is actually executing.  For example, you could put an alert in the body of your anonymous function.  The function might not be executing, for instance, if your actual http request is malformed or incorrectly processed on the server.  If the function *does* execute, then the problem is likely with how you append values to your table.  If it does not, then you might want to use jquery's .ajax call instead with an error function so that you can at least see why it fails.  Either way, post back the results.",1

Most hash passwords algorithms don't protect you from **Rainbow Tables** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table,1
"Usually, TLS is considered the preferred method of protecting data between client and server.  If you're not doing `https://` for passwords, you're in a world of hurt.  SHA1 (or in the past MD5) could be used to store a salted hash in the DB for later...  I guess you could do the hash on the client, but that probably isn't typical (for one thing client likely won't know salt).  @jean That's what salt is for...",1
"*au contraire* @ebyrob that's what rainbow tables are for (defeat salted hash) the problem with hash they are very fast to calculate since they are intended to hash entire files and ended used to hash small strings. The only way to avoid RT now is using a ""slow"" hash",1
You've got so much misinformation in this question that it's worrying to an extreme. A guide like [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/) outlines the recommended best practices and is an **essential read**.

@jean But one would need to build the rainbow table for each salt individually. That’s the exact purpose of salts.,1
"@jean Perhaps I'm just quibbling about terms.  If you generate an entire unique rainbow-table for each user in the database after you get your hands on the password file, I'd hardly call that ""pre-computing"".",1
"That's just more one dimension on the rainbow. A table can get n dimensions, use one for user, other for possible passwords, another for salts and go on",1

Adding a ""full-dimension"" with 2048 bits.. 1 with 600 0's vs storage of the whole cloud 1 with 25 0's.  Math wins.  (Unless I totally misunderstand the concept).

"I think it's really misleading of Google to give an answer like this.  Exactly what proportion of a year ""259 days, 5 hours, 54 minutes"" amounts to depends on which year it is, and also whether daylight savings starts or ends during the 259 days.

@tnw I apologize. I likely didn't use the best terminology to research what I wanted to do. I had this `try catch` set up days ago because I ran into the error once and didn't want the user to see the specifics of the error and saw using a `CustomException` as a solution at the time.,1

An ordinary member function declaration specifies three logically distinct things

However, in a textbook I am reading they give an example of a class ( Person ) and they say that it is equivalent to the exact same thing plus this ->. And then they say

You failed to initialize `total`. Use `int total = 0;`.,1

"@LukasThomsen: Actually using an uninitialized variable as an R-value invokes undefined behavior. The compiler may do anything if it sees that, including (but not limited) to emitting a program, that wipes all the storage in the computer.",1
@datenwolf I agree to your statement but the undefined behavior results from the memory of the variable not being initialized. When the application is loaded `total` gets a place in memory. This memory can contain any value depending on what the memory was previously used for. Therefore the value of `total` is undefined and may change each time you execute the application looking random for the application.,1
"@LukasThomsen: That's just one way how undefined behavior may manifest. UB is UB and **anything** can happen. It has nothing to do with the ""variable being placed somewhere"". If the compiler sees, that a value is read from an uninitialized variable it may **and will** do really weird stuff. Random values poping up  are the least of your problems.

"On which line do you get the error? Btw, you should never just try and suppress errors.",1
There's not 34 lines in the above. Please mark the lines with a comment.,1
Sorry. It's been corrected.,1
there is no code in your question that tries to get a property of an object ... also no have no constructor for your article class so check out what new Article($row) really produces or what $row contains,1
`conn` and `sql` should be `$conn` and `$sql`. Close this please.,1

"Seems odd that it would tell you that there are errors on lines 3, 4 and 5. It would usually hit one and throw an error, not collect data from all errors and show them to you.",1

"It's `>=`. You call it *greater than or equal to*, not *equal to or greater than*, hence first `>` then `=`.

"Numerous things are wrong with this. When you are programming, everything has to be *exact* and spelled perfectly. It's `raw_input(prompt_str)` not `raw_input()(prompt_str)` or `raw-input`. It's `if x < y` or `if x is y` not `if x is < y`, etc.",1
"Change the line `if age is => 21:` to `if age >= 21:`.  There is no `is` and (as Bakuriu said), the greater than sign comes before the equals.

Hint: You don't really need a loop. You could solve this with just a little bit of math.,1

@itsme86 Of course this only works for numbers which are powers of 10.,1

@chris Can you point me to what Eric said?,1
The `using` statement is not meant for catching exceptions. It's meant to be used to ensure that `Dispose()` is called even if you have an exception. It's the equivilent of doing a `Try/Catch/Finally` and putting the `Dispose()` in the `Finally`.,1
@ZivS That's pretty much what I expected I'd hear :),1

@Dave I'll take a look at that,1
@Dave Oh nevermind lol,1
"Well, here's some legitimate reading for you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator It's a very complex subject, but there are many algorithms out there for turning sequential inputs into difficult-to-predict outputs. But then, they're all built for single-seed, multi-read, meaning they have a slow startup time. As I said in a comment on an answer, you'd be better off defining simple seeds for entire chunks of your landscape and generating all the numbers for each chunk at once (with coords in the same order!). Then you get deterministic behaviour and fast processing.",1

Three inputs guaranteed to return same output is not a random number generator or even pseudorandomness.,1
"@Blam Ok, fine, you win. I was looking for a function with three inputs that returns a number that is different then all the others depending on the x, y, and seed values. Is that too much to ask?",1
Then ask that question.,1
"@Blam This sort of thing is what pseudo-random generators are for: repeatable results with random-like distributions. Just consider all three inputs to be parts of the same seed. The OP should have posted asking about a pseudo-random generator rather than a random generator, but I think that's splitting hairs (besides, not everybody knows about random vs pseudo-random)",1
@Dave Thanks for the support on that,1
"@Blam I edited my question. Just for future reference, what would the new method be considered? Would it be random or psuedorandom, or something else?",1
I would call it a method that returs a repeatable output (I would so use decimal over float) from three integer inputs that preserves a pseudo-random output with only one of the three inputs as static random input.  I am not a statistician but I am a programmer and mathematician.,1

You could also use a `std::vector<int> c(100);`,1
"In modern clean C++ application code (evolution completed by C++14 and `make_unique`), if you use any of `new`, `delete`, raw pointers or even (in most cases) C style arrays, you are doing something wrong. Use C++ (STL or other) containers, values with move semantics when practical, and smart pointers like `unique_ptr` for heap allocations. It might be better to learn these first, and leave more primitive stuff for later (maybe after learning the implementation of library-like template classes).",1
"@hyde I would even go so far and argue that learning to deal with `new` and `delete` is only useful if you have to maintain legacy code bases. There is absolutely no need to learn about them otherwise, *not even late*; you would just be burning precious brain cycles for zero benefit.",1

i want substring,1
it should start just before last occurence of '.',1
"The question is worded very strangely. The character before `'.'` in this example is `'o'`. If what you want is the substring *between* the last `'/'` and the last `'.'`, please specify that more clearly. That will probably help you avoid a lot of downvotes.",1

You create multiple empty arrays and then try to access them. Hence your out of bounds exception,1
You're not returning any reference there and you **are** indeed leaking memory.,1
"You're returning a copy and then leaking memory, so it is indeed dangerous, but allowed.",1

"@Bazooka, even if you changed the function to return `int&`, you'd still likely leak memory, because people don't expect that a `int&` returned from a function was allocated with `new`, so they won't call `delete (&returned_int)` Edit: However, it is indeed legal. A bit obscene, but legal in C++",1
@AndyG: Fair point mate. How about I use a smart (unique) pointer. How about now?,1
@Bazooka depends on what type of smart pointer you're using :),1
"@Bazooka, unless you're returning the unique pointer, it will go out of scope at the end of your function and delete its allocated memory, meaning accessing the address of the returned `int` will result in undefined behavior.",1
"Please stop editing the question. The answer keeps changing depending on your edits, because you keep changing the question!",1
"@Bazooka, Sorry, but as it stands, what you have will definitely result in undefined behavior. In fact, really only the first post you had would have resulted in a well behaving function from an API standpoint. The second edit would have likely resulted in a memory leak.",1
Jesus Christ! You guys know way better than our instructors. How come man! How do I become like one of you and not like my instructor?,1

Is this the HTML from your file or the actual output?,1
Use your browser's DOM inspector to see what rules are being applied to those elements. it could be something like a `!important` rule elsewhere overriding your css as posted here.,1
"My guess is rather that this is in the HTML file but the browser renders it differently since block elements (h1) are not allowed inside inline elements (span). Thus, the actual output won't have a `h1` inside `.testimonial`. At least, some editors like CKEditor filter such constructs.",1

Looks like something a compiler would need to do if parsing source code and checking for correctness. Are you looking for these patterns in strings?  You probably need something with backreferences - and positive/negative  lookaheads.

After being made aware of my superfluous and actively harmful contributions to your questions I removed all my comments and my answer in the spirit of harm reduction and the promotion of conciseness. Should you still be interested in my proposed solution it can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Rusk85/7b9d782570e96a7c9e4389f3e0edbe7e). I apologize for all the damage I have done and I hope none of it is of the lasting kind.,1
Can anyone figure out what in the world is OP asking? Supposedly there were comments clarifying but none is left.,1
"@Braiam Here is the former suggested edit, the answer in question containing all the comments as well as the reasons for rejection of the suggested edit => [Comments below solution](https://gist.github.com/Rusk85/d6db941889420906a02ddad4684b56b1)",1
@Braiam after seeing the big fuss about this on Meta I decided to undelete my answer along with OPs comments. As for the rough content of my 2nd rejected edit please refer to my answer on [Meta](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/345285/1352384). After the first flat out rejection of the first reviewer who obviously didn't bother to check the OPs further requirements he made in the comments to my answer I was fed up and reverted my 2nd review back to the initial OPs answer mid pending approval so only my final edits (the rollback in this case) can be seen.

You do not have a `return 0;` statement at the end of `main`.  How is main going to return anything without a return statement?,1
non-void functions must return something.,1
@abelenky `main()` has an implicit `return 0;`.,1
@abelenky In c++ `main` will implicitly return 0 if no return statement is encountered. It's a rule unique to `main`.,1
"*The programm compiles with no errors* -- But I bet you had warnings about returning nothing from a function that is supposed to return something, like your `setWeaponName` function.  The code as-is invokes undefined behavior due to this issue.",1
"@juanchopanza: while true, by pointing that out to a novice programmer, you are encouraging sloppy programming!  If the desire is for a value to be returned, it should be explicitly done, and not rely on implicit behavior.  Implicit behavior can come later when the program actually works.",1
i put return 0; on main and a return to the other fuctions but i have still the same problem,1
"@abelenky BS. There's nothing sloppy about omitting a return 0 from main(). If you actually write `return 0; ` I'd have to ask if you knew what you were doing. You are actually confusing a new comer by implying main needs an explicit return statement, and that their code is faulty for not having it.",1
"Once I clean up all of the setter functions that return nothing by replacing the return type with void, I get a tonne of errors. Good odds that all of the invalid functions confused the heck out of the  compiler and produced a completely batsmurf program.",1

@George its a necessary requirement for the homework to put setters and getters,1

here is a working code  cpp.sh/46j35 the main and only problem was with your setters return type (should be `void`) - I have no idea why that even compiled,1
"Tactical point expanding on @George 's comment: If a variable has a getter and a setter and the setter does nothing to protect the variable from someone injecting a bad value, you might as well make the variable `public` and remove the setter and getter. Setters are all about the object protecting itself. If it's not protecting itself, the setter is just more code that can have a bug in it.",1

"@KonstantinosMoulakis The code contains no pointers, no arrays, no calls to `new`, etc.  So the only thing I can see that would cause it to not work is (and this is the third time mentioning this) -- *your functions that are marked as returning `string` that fail to return a `string` are the most likely cause for the errors*.

You have it. Recommend generalizing the function a bit and passing in `'insert char here'` and a string containing a longer description of the sport as parameters. That way you only have to write one function for all sports.,1

"And part three, in `input_reservation` the line `sport_type[index] = input_type(sport_type, index);` counts on `input_type` returning the correct value, so currently the code blows itself up by not returning. Ideologically, a function should do only one thing, so input should just take input and hand that input off to someone who knows how best to store it. The simpler a function is, the easier it is to debug. So `char input_type(char sport_type[], int index)` should probably be `char input_type()`, read the user input into a temporary value, test the value and return the value when it's good.",1

Then which time zone do you want to format in?,1
Neither. Timezone is unknown.,1
"Then `Date` isn't what you want, as that represents an *instant* in time, which only has a local year/month/day/hour/minute/second when you apply a time zone. The same instant has different values in different time zones, and they don't make sense without a time zone. It's like asking for the binary encoding of a string without specifying an encoding...",1
"@JonSkeet no, `Date` represents measure of time. It can mean one instant in one timezone and another instant in another.",1
"@JonSkeet no, it's like asking a distance without specifying an origin. We have `double` type which holds this. Nobody requires to provide units of measurement and origin for doubles. The same should be for date-time.",1
"@Dims: No, it really doesn't `Date` is an instant in time - a number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. It's not since some arbitrary point in time - it has a well-specified origin. The longer you fight against this, the longer you will have problems. *Please* accept it. If you don't believe me, you should read the `java.util.Date` documentation, which starts ""The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision.""",1
Your code is correct. You are also correct that it depends on your JVM's time zone and for the same `Date` object will produce differnt results in different time zones. Exactly therefore you need to specify for which time zone you want the result.,1
"If all you have is a point in absolute time (relative to UNIX timestamp), there is no way to format it without a time zone, because that will display as a different time in different time zones.  Where, and in what format, does your value come from?",1
@SLaks suppose it is in Shire,1
@JonSkeet what are you saying does imply UTC.,1
"@Dims: If you have a timezone, you can specify that timezone and you won't have a problem.",1
@SLaks I have no timezone. I have `HH:MM:SS` from third party source. It's timezone if unknown and may mean different instant than one I get if parse this string.,1
"@JonSkeet see my very simple example code, showing, that `Date` is not instant.",1
"@Slaks it not only format matter, you can also call `getHours()` getter and see the same. `Date()` is JUST NOT AN INSTANCE if you use it's components in any way. And you use it in numerous cases. For example, if you read `Date` from database server by clients all over the world, you will get the same components, but different `getTime()`.",1
"IOW, you _don't_ have an absolute time.  You want https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalTime.html",1
"Your tests don't show what you seem to think it shows. You're parsing it in the system default time zone, and constructing 1970-01-01T00:00:01 *in the system default time zone*. However, I'm done here. You're ignoring both what the documentation says and what someone with considerably experience in date/time work says. You're welcome to do that of course, but you're not going to make any progress. You should follow SLaks advice and use `LocalTime`, as that's what the value you're receiving represents. It doesn't represent an unambiguous instant in time.",1
@JonSkeet and you are ignoring how `Date` is used in numerous libraries and tools. I am done here too.,1
"@SLaks I don't want absolute time, I want relative time.",1
"Then you want `LocalTime` or `LocalDateTime`, as that's precisely what they model.",1
"A `Date` only contains an instant. Whether it contains a *correct* instance, well, if it contains an incorrect one it certainly wouldn’t be the first time. In you so-called(!) proof, it contains an instant of 2 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds before the epoch — which in turn tells me you JVM’s time zone is at an offset of 3 hours from UTC.",1
"Dims, I believe the real answer to your question is: stay away from `java.util.Date`. It confuses you, and there’s no reason why you should want that. Use the newer classes in `java.time` instead, like those @JonSkeet mentions.",1
"_I don't want absolute time, I want relative time._ I think what you are looking for is `Duration` or `Period` from `java.time`. Even so numerous libraries and tools use `Date` doesn't mean it's correct.",1
"@LukasWöhrl, that depends on relative to what. If relative to a time zone, Jon Skeet’s suggestion is better. If relative between two points in time, you are entirely correct.",1
"@LukasWöhrl I agree it is not correct, this is my point. And it is not ""an instant"", but it is dual. Second nature of `Date` appears not in formatting only, but in many cases.",1
"@OleV.V. absolutely, just wanted to throw those into the field, as they haven't mentioned yet. @ Dims This simply shows that time is a **very** complex field. Jon Skeet is an expert there, trust him.",1
"I agree in your view that the `Date` class was designed with a “second nature”. I just meant to say, the state a `Date` object holds is an instant only. The second nature is in constructors, the methods, particularly the many deprecated methods, but also in `toString()`. This design is generally considered poor in retrospect and is one of the reasons new classes were designed twice, first `Calendar` and later all the `java.time` classes.",1
@Dims Assume you have a `Date` object created by expression `new Date(60*1000)`. What is the expected String you want to generate from this?,1
"@OleV.V. according to OOP paradigm, the internals of object is black box; the ""true nature"" of object -- is what you can get from it or set to it by it's methods. You can't say, that some of methods are ""true"" and another methods are ""false"". The matter of fact is that `Date` class has TWO contracts, regardless the number of downvotes and regardless documentation. There are a lot of libraries, that READ datetime and present it in `Date` format for java. In this moment, the contract of ""number of milliseconds from UNIX era"" is violated.",1
@infiniteRefactor in my situation I am receiving date time from another source and it is constructed from parts. And I need to print exactly these parts. Your case is irrelevant.,1
"@Dims If the `Date` is constructed from, say, year, month, day in month, hrs and min and you cannot guess the time zone used when constructing it, there is no way you can fulfil the requirement of printing those parts from the `Date`.",1
"@Dims OK. Assume you have a `Date` object created by expression `new Date(70, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)`. What is the expected String you want to generate from this?",1
"@infiniteRefactor something like `1970-01-01 00:01:00` Order should depend on format, but components should be kept.",1
"@OleV.V. Please, understand, that timezone should not be part of date, because date should measure time, while timezone is a measure for space. We are not storing kilograms, meters, and so on units in double. And whe should not keep timezone in Date.",1
"Your ""Update 4"" only proves that `getHours()` reflects the local time zone, which you are changing.  If one repeatedly evaluates `a+b`, and gets different sums when changing `b`, that doesn't mean that `a` is also changing.",1
"@MattJohnson but this means that `a+b` contains also `b`, but not only `a`.",1
"""Contains"" is the wrong word, but sure, `a+b` *is dependent on* both `a` and `b`, in the same way that the hour returned from `getHours` is dependent on both the instant held by the `Date` object and the local time zone.  That does not mean that the instant changes when you change the time zone, no more than it means that `a` changes when you change `b`.",1
"Also, you say in the sample: ""hours property"".  However, `date.getHours()` is a method, not a property.  Java doesn't have properties in the same way that C# has. [It only has methods.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2963249/634824).  A method that takes as input some outside information cannot be described as [pure](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22395430/634824).  Therefore, what you are observing is simply that the `getHours` method is impure because it takes the system time zone as one of its inputs.",1
"@MattJohnson expression `a+b` namely CONTAINS `b`. You MAY say ""depends on"", but you can't say ""contains"" is wrong. 

I never said instant changes, I only said `Date` contains not only instant and this is true. Date is the same as `a+b` in your excellent example, where `a` is an instant and `b` is timezone.

In terms of Java bean convention, `getHours` is a property getter for property ""hours"". I may rewrite access to this property with any bean library. The fact that getters in Java do not have additional brace level changes nothing.

Of course you may say `getHours` is ""impure"".",1
"I believe that it is finally clear what the problem is here. If class `a` has a method `getData` and this `getData` method is returning `a` internal state (which is an instant) modified by some external value (let's skip the timezone, let's say it's user's screen resolution) does this make `a` an instant or not. And does this imply that `a` stores screen resolution or not.  I believe that this is simply semantics thing - how you define what is an instant? It seems that most people define instant differently from the question's author...",1
@PawelGradecki I understand instant as a point on time dimension. I don't deny `Date` contains instant. I deny it IS an instant. We may say it is IMPURE instant if you wish. The very fact that `Date` has so much depreated methods (and that there are so many alternative implementations) alone proves that `java.util.Date` is both impure and bad design.,1
"Ok I understand what you mean,  but can you refer to the example with screen resolution? If the class with a private instant field would have a `getData` method which would return value based on local screen resolution (or any other environmental data), would that mean that it is not instant? Just want to make sure that I get your instant definition right. I believe that a game changer here would be to provide a definition of an ""instant"" from some trustful source, because the discussion is about instants and nobody posted any definition yet.",1
"@PawelGradecki it depends on whether it is possible to reach instant pure. If the class would have only `getData()` which returns only instant, dirtied with screen resolution, I would say either it is not instant, or some special sort of instant, defined by class designer. I am opened to any definition, but it should not drift.",1

I'm going to guess in your `main` method you created a `VendingMachine` with 20 cans (or 10 cans and `add(10)` cans) then `insertToken()`x2. There's your output.,1
It's because of `machine.add(10)`. Either delete it or rewrite your expected count.,1

1) A default constructor, VendingMachine(), that initializes the vending machine with
10 soda cans
2) A constructor, VendingMachine(int cans), that initializes the vending machine
with the given number of cans
Both constructors should initialize the token count to 0.",1

I'm just trying to figure out what correction should I make in order to let the token count to be 0.,1

How does using a **single** `word` array answer your goal of separating a sentence into words???,1

"So what have you posted this code for??? If you want us to refer to ""your real code"", then post your real code, not something else.",1
"@barakmanos: They are not, most of the world uses [utf-8](http://utf8everywhere.org/). Anyway, my point is that separating sentence into words based on whitespace is incorrect.",1
"@ybungalobill: Whatever, that's not `char`.",1
"@Zee: Please post your actual code, and please explain (as I have already noted to you in one of the comments above) how exactly you want to have these words separated (because at present, you may as well print the sentence as is, and the words will ""come out separated"").",1
@barakmanos: `utf-8` **is** `char` on lots of systems. I can pass Chinese into this code on any UNIX system.,1
"@ybungalobill: Well, not on all systems, and half of the questions/answers on this website will not work for Chinese (specifically questions and answers about ASCII characters, specifically on systems which do not support Chinese ""natively"").",1
"@Zee if its space than compare to `' '` instead of 32. Also AFAIK, the character encoding is not guaranteed/required to be ascii so this code would not be portable with that magic constant.",1

"Haskell's type classes are not a form of object-orientation. They are a form of ad-hoc polymorphism, which you typically also get from object systems. But they do not couple data and methods, which is the hallmark of object-orientation.",1
@sclv They do in fact couple data and methods - the type of the data determines which function (or which part of the function definition if you want to view it that way) is called.,1
that couples the *type* of the data and methods! http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/OOP_vs_type_classes,1
"@sclv is right; Haskell typeclasses are much closer to OOP interfaces than OOP classes, but even that analogy isn't perfect. In fact, the closest thing to OOP classes in Haskell are simply [data types containing functions and monadic actions](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FAQ#I.27m_making_an_RPG._Should_I_define_a_type_for_each_kind_of_monster.2C_and_a_type_class_for_them.3F).",1
"@sclv Yes, and that is characteristic of object oriented languages. Only a minority associate operations with instances at all; in even fewer can that be described as the normal operation of the OO system.",1
"@sclv I dont think this is true (although it is an acceptable ""lie to children"").  If you dont think about the constraint system, typeclasses are just a slightly restricted object system.  In that typeclasses have 1. subtyping 2. implicit self reference 3. replaceable self reference (aka inheritance).  A typeclass is just a (parameterized) abstract class in oop while an instance is just an object that inherits from that abstract class.  With GHC 7.4 and some trickery involving `newtype`, `unsafeCoerce` and implicit parameters this correspondence becomes complete.",1
"I also think that ""couple data and methods"" is really independent from OO.  Consider Go as the example of a language where methods are separate from structs, yet it is very OOP.",1
"On the other hand, the naive view that typeclasses are equivalent to interfaces and that datatypes in Haskell are equivalent to classes in OOP that implement those interfaces is just wrong.  The typeclass system is a layer used for defining classes (in the mathematical sense, aka predicates) over Haskell types.  It just happens to be an Object Oriented layer to for defining predicates over Haskell types.",1
@PhilipJF My answer in no way relies on OO being able to do everything that Haskell type classes can do. It relies on the Haskell type class system being able to do everything that OO can.,1
"@PhilipJF Don't know why I'm responding to this nonsense, but typeclasses don't have subtyping, don't have implicit self reference, and don't have inheritance. The ""Haskell's Overlooked Object System"" paper has a good discussion of why typeclasses don't do the job (and hence what it proposes instead), and I think the O'Haskell paper also motivate the differences quite well. Anyway, implicit parameters are not idiomatic Haskell these days, and unlikely to make it into a standard, and once you start to involve unsafeCoerce then you're clearly off the reservation.",1
"@sclv I'm not sure what either of those papers have to do with my claim.  The class per class encoding is clumsy, I agree. My point is more subtle.  Typeclasses in Haskell are classes over types.  We are all constructivist here, so for us to suppose a type is a member of a typeclass requires some sort of ""evidence object"".  Further, the language provides an automatic theorem proving system in the form of inference and global instances.  My claim is only that the proof language for this logic is OO, and it is helpful for reasoning about Haskell to be aware of this fact.",1
"The ""evidence type"" for membership in `Ord` is a subtype of the evidence type for membership in `Eq`.  Implicit this references and inheritance are what let you declare `m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k"" in the definition of `Monad`.  To simulate this behavior with records requires finding a fix-point (as pointed out by Oleg), which should clue you in something is up.  The reason this shouldn't be surprising is that typeclasses sit on the other-side of the ""expresion problem"" from Abstract Data Types.  From William Cooks work we know that means they are probably objects.",1
"Obviously this object system is a restricted one, but you just need to look at Bruno Oliveira's work to know that is a non-essential aspect (see Scala's implicits).  My point about `unsafeCoerce` is that with some extensions and unsafe features you can actually get your hands on the Objects that bare witness to type-class membership  , and using implicit parameters you can construct arbitrary such instances at runtime (although it relies on the compiler not obeying its documentation).",1
"@PhilipJF the ""evidence type"" for membership in Ord (dictionary, I suppose you mean) isn't a subtype of the evidence type for membership in Eq. It's just that Ord membership implies Eq membership. An ord instance can't ""override"" Eq methods. I have no idea what you're getting at with the monad example -- yes if you encode monads with objects, then the encoding is object-y, but that's because you chose an object-y encoding to begin with! Anyway, this ""evidence type"" doesn't always exist. Other implementations of Haskell, such as JHC, show you can go very far without a dictionary encoding.",1
"@sclv A proof of membership in Ord is a proof of membership in Eq.  ""is a"" is the same thing as subtype.  The Monad example is about inheritance (not subtyping, they are separate) since unless a Monad instance overrides the default definition of `>>` it inherits a general one, but this general one uses `>>=` which is defined virtually.  This is what I was talking about in terms of ""implicit this parameter"" and inheritance.   The point that you dont have direct access to this object system and that it isn't always implemented directly, doesn't really matter.  It explains the semantics.",1
But you can explain the semantics *without* an object system too. Does the fact that I can explain counting with pebbles mean that naturals are a *kind* of collection of pebbles?,1
@sclv An object system is anything that meets certain criteria. You cannot say the same of a collection of pebbles.,1
"that is a good point.  I find that thinking about typeclasses as objects plus a Prolog like theorem prover (where every rule begins with a cute) makes it easier to reason about something rather complicated, and gives me access to a body of literatures and design principles that apply to my problem.  Thinking about C++ templates as a functional language sort of like Haskell makes them easier to reason about also.  I generally try to understand the weird edges of mathematical systems by describing them in terms of axioms I already know.  You dont need ring theory to explain integers.",1
"I want to send the list<int> through TCP, and I've already get the server and client connected. Now, I need send the list<int> data from client to server. I know the method send() is based on char* or char[]. I don't know how to deal with list<int>. Thank you very much",1
you can turn the list of integers into a single string and parse it out on the other side.,1
How many integers do you have? It could be good enough to convert int to string (snprintf() f.e) and send each one with send().,1

"@DrakeGuan: You should change the title of your question to reflect your last comment. What's the difference between pip and setup.py isn't much of a question, it seems like you're actually interested in something a bit more specific.",1
"Sure, Thanks a lot!",1
"@DrakeGuan If you want the behaviour of `pip`, use `pip`.",1
"That's somewhat misleading, though - `pip` does use `setup.py`. I'm sure if you get the right options, or possibly use a wrapper script, it's possible to get the same results with setup.py.",1
"This is incorrect. In most cases, pip does download the package from PyPI, unzip it and run the setup.py script (albeit with some extra options). If you try to have pip install from a tarball for example without a setup.py, you'll get an error saying so.",1
"@ThomasK Sure, but that's not the question - the question is why the one does not give identical results to the other.",1
"@Marcin: Obviously they're not the same program: they have different names. But your answer fails to highlight the connection (one calls the other), or explain how to get `setup.py` to do what the OP wants. So it's technically correct, but not useful. @vartec has provided what the OP was almost certainly looking for.",1
@Marcin: Implying that they're entirely separate when `pip` calls `setup.py` is misleading.,1
"@ThomasK Not really. `pip` probably also uses `list`, but it doesn't follow that they are connected. The question does not ask ""how can I re-implement `pip` myself"".",1
"@Marcin: In the context of installing a package, pip and setup.py are clearly connected.",1
"@ThomasK They may be ""connected"" but the question doesn't ask ""are they connected"" - it asks why they don't have the exact same behaviour, and the answer is because they are not supposed to. That's all there is to it; how they achieve those effects is not relevant.",1
@ThomasK What other answer is there? There is no reason whatsoever to expect them to have the same behaviour. You might as well complain that I haven't dumped the whole code for pip in my answer.,1
@Marcin: Of course you can expect them to have similar behaviour: they both serve to install a Python package. It's different behaviour that needs explanation. As for another answer: @vartec's answer is a good start - providing a single option to `setup.py` makes it behave like `pip`. That's relevant and likely useful.,1
"@ThomasK Why does different behaviour need explanation? `pip` does not advertise that it provides identical behaviour (nor vice versa). In so far as they are supposed to be similar, they are similar: they install a python package. To expect a different explanation is like asking why you and I don't use the same writing style: neither of us has indicated that we would.",1
@Marcin: Different behaviour requires explanation because the question is about the difference in behaviour. Where would humanity be if we never asked how or why?,1
"@Marcin: Almost all code questions could be answered by reading enough source, but asking can give more useful information more quickly. Re different things: see red/blue example above.",1
"@ThomasK The reason why you don't perceive blue and red as exactly the same thing is because they are not exactly the same thing. There is no deeper explanation than that. If you want to inquire into the mechanisms of perception, that is a different question.",1
"@Marcin: In both the OP's question and my red/blue example, saying ""because they're different"" does not convey any information that the asker did not already know. Assuming the question is posed in order to gain information, an answer that does not provide information has no value. A useful answer to the OP's question might discuss how the difference is implemented, or why developers chose different mechanisms. For the red/blue conundrum, a useful answer might cover wavelengths of light, pigments, and colour receptors in the eye.",1
"@Marcin: The details of the way that the programme/eye works can be informative and interesting. Given that the question is asked to gain information, if the literal answer to the question contains no information, we can infer that we have misunderstood what the asker wants. In that case, we can attempt to infer the question they meant to ask, and provide useful information. This process does not always work perfectly, but it's better than an answer with no information.",1
"@ThomasK You may doubt your powers of comprehension, but I am confident in my own. When someone asks a nonsensical question, I assume they don't know that what they are asking is nonsensical, rather than inferring that it is an oblique way of soliciting a general disquisition on the topics mentioned. In that case, informing them that their question is nonsensical is new information.",1
"@Marcin: No, the question can be clearly understood to have a rational answer, more specific than a general discussion. Possible readings are ""how can I make them behave in the same way"" (which vartec answered), ""how do they achieve different results"" (similar), or ""why did the developers choose different mechanisms?"" (we can presume the `pip` developers were aware of the other mechanism).",1
"@ThomasK Leave the votes of others out of it - you are still arguing that I should make up a new question. If you want this to be a different question, go ahead and edit it.",1
"@Marcin: The votes of others became relevant when the discussion moved to what SO is about. In as much as SO is a community, what it is about is determined by the opinions of its members.",1
"@ThomasK Well, if you really want to argue about that, it turns out that SO users don't have to leave a reasoned explanation for their downvotes. For example, I am getting a bunch of downvotes on old questions, which I assume come from you (for obvious reasons) and vartec (whenever he sees my handle he is reminded that I once pointed out an error in one of his answers). So no, they don't really convey much information.",1

Consider it the price of being able to do two things at once -- you give up some control over exactly *in what order* they get done.  If you want stuff to run in a particular order, you'll have to do some synchronization (read: making threads block!) just to get what sequential processing gives you for free.",1

This means, either we allow both, or none.  And again, I repeat: `import` is not accessing external resources like `#include <stdio.h>` isn't cheating and linking in standard C libraries isn't, too.  Only using too high level functions is cheating!  And my argument is, that `import` is even a lower level construct than `%`!  So using any is cheating.

"[PPCG has a good definition of quines](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4877/what-counts-as-a-proper-quine).`repr()` does _not_ use reflection. It is a standard function that takes string inputs and outputs other strings. An example would be does `repr(input())` read the source at all? The string just happens to include part of the source, as the source defines the string (As what else would when hard-coding a string?). And `%` on a string is just string formatting. Formatting is also a function that doesn't rely on the source, just the arguments (i.e. no side effects.)",1

OnShow is NOT where you INITIALIZE the form! That should be done inside of OnCreate. OnShow is called every time a ShowModal occurs. Your code isn't calling ShowModal. It's not even calling Create, which is when OnCreate is called (once). Self and Form1 are referring to the same object!",0

It might work, but from an OOD/OOP standpoint, it's wrong. The whole approach is wrong anyway! But you're not listening to anything any of us have to say in that respect.

Please learn to use the search function on Stack Overflow. This question has been asked many many times before.,0
No one is going to write your code for you. Check out some [jQuery tutorials and read through the documentation](http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page) and come back when you run into a specific issue or problem.,0
"we don't know what your errors are, what your code looks like, what you are trying to do - so how can we possibly help?!?",0
Very basic stuff.. 1 second google: http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.post.php,0
"**NO**, you can not do that from a website. And I am very glad you can not. Also, Control-Alt-Delete is *meant* not to be able to be captured by a normal program as a security feature (so that you know that the resulting prompt could only be from Windows itself)",0

"To be honest, you are all a bit quick to judge from the question alone. There are valid applications where stuff like this is useful or even mandatory: cashpoints, school assignments, kiosk apps in production lines, ...",0
"@phresnel - we were quick to judge because the question did not contain important, relevant information.  The phrase 'kiosk app' would have prevented all the aggro.  The point is that such apps as you mention are run on secure hardware, often with special human-interfaces, eg. keypads, touchscreens, not a standard PC keyboard.  The desire of the OP can certainly be met, (on XP anyway, as anyone who has used a hotel lobby pay-per-minute internet kiosk will know), but I'm not sure how it's done - it's probably non-trivial.",0
What exactly are you asking?,0
"@user1781384, Then next time, don't tag `java`!!!!!!!",0
Did you just list every language you know?,0
If you want a generic solution there's an `Language Agnostic` tag you should be using.,0
Have you tried it?,0
"Did you try it? And **why not**? Also even if it is valid _syntactically_, it is not wise because of the _semantics_ to use an `int` with the name `π`. As you might have heard of it, `π` is a mathemathical constant...",0

First of all you should learn Objective-C.,0
What doesn't work? #What error do you get? What have you done to troubleshoot this?,0
this makes no sense(returns a constant if you initialize the variables) and doesn't even compile because you use uninitialized variables.,0
"*if the guy types in ""haha lol XD""*  ....then you should probably beat the crap out of him.",0
This question appears to be off-topic because it is too-localised.,0
"Did you try looking for ""loop javascrip"" or ""javascript interval"" ? Do it.",0
"Come one, what's the code you've attempted?",0
Good luck getting one.  I would expect these to be totally identical.,0
"A logical explanation of what, exactly? *Why* they're nearly identical? Because they're essentially the same comparison.",0
This is horrible advice - and only artificially extends how many more fragments you can pack in - this problem still remains. Google explicitly states not to use this to address memory leaks.,0
You should never store the password in plaintext.,0
"if you guys don't like my opinion just post something else... it is a matter of opinion after all, I changed some of my phrasings, I think some people got very sentimental about this",0
"lovely idea, but this is NOT how it works. your reply is not an answer and shouldn't have been posted as one.",0
@nyne An altogether wrong answer is still an answer.,0
completely incorrect answer,0
"Yeah, this doesn't work. Produces an exact duplicate of the gif.",0
"I've never seen a -23 answer before. Err, sorry -24.",0
Unlucky the guy's answer got accepted because that pins the answer up. You often only see a few because they sink to the bottom pretty quickly so nobody pays attention to it. :),0
"whenever you learn a new language, the first thing you should read are the operators. read the reference before posting",0
Very basic question that smells like homework.,0
@Jack - You need to understand how to accomplish it.. someone else doing it won't help. I really suggest P&P - paper pencil,0
Did you forget to have *coffee* today?,0
Please provide what you have tried so far.,0
"`!` is an unary operator, so-called **not**. Do googling about C operators unary/bitwise ones",0

"You don't need to write the type down, but if you can't figure it out on your own that just means you don't actually know what your program does.",0

"Still shouldn't be used at it looks horrible and devs maintaining your markup in the future will think it's okay to reuse if you've used it - and they may not style out its inherent ugliness. In practice, it's to be avoided.",0
Personally I'd avoid the thickness as it looks chunky....,0
