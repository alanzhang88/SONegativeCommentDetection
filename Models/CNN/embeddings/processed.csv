in your function youre not returning anything just printing the result since you want to save the name of the two groups being tested and their respective xsquared value you should preallocate a vector for names vs  characterchoose6 2 and one for xsq xsq  numericchoose6 2 and in each iteration save your n and k in the respective vector btw it should be more convenient to make your function as a binary eg myfun  functionx y setnameschisqtestx y  pastex vs y and use combn to apply your function to all combinations of your column,1

this solution is simple readable and obvious,0
try to do some research before posting this is really a basic question,0
"this is a relatively basic question but the reason im downvoting it is because you have not provided enough information for anyone to give you an answer

to make the question appropriate you should at the least describe or provide the structure of the tables you want to query  in addition you may want to specify if you are querying using sql linq or some other accessor",0

this question appears to be offtopic because it is about a typo,0
downvoting because this answer is misleading described features of arraylist are found in the list too,0
hahah  i have problem what is answer,0
please consider searching the stackoverflow threads and other mediums before posting a question additionally make sure you post a question showing what you have tried,0
you mean like google,0
what do you want to know you have a method signature and an example call there is nothing more to be said about the code you posted,0
why am i garnering minuses on my question is it because people dont know the answer and want to take it out on the asker,0
codeinchaos how would you use this how is it useful how is it a method signature im used to seeing like public int testint a string b if it were like that it would make more sense,0
  and boltclock yes it is c if i put it into a solution it doesnt yell at me and even provides intellisense for the test method if indeed that is what it is as for compiling it nothing seems to happen it doesnt yell at me at the very least,0
that doesnt look like real sourcecode i cant think of a context where these two lines would compile if you claim that it compiles please post a compilable sample its just the method signature with an omitted body since documentation usually doesnt contain the method body,0
is this the full code sample,0
please post the link to the original doxygen example,0
not even the version you posted now compiles you cant have a method with no body inside a class,0
i ran it in vs2010 runs and compiles but does nothing,0
  doesnt compile for me,0
is this homework if not this is a remarkably bad method to do this operation,0
also if working fine means that the binary equivalent of 0xff is 1515 somethings wrong with my math skills,0
you should look in the forums first before posting questions that have been already answered,0
  son where did i cry ive just tried to explained to you that you didnt understand what im asking about,0
  9 out of ten persons who know c and qt if you tell them words signalslot will immediately associate this with typical qt pattern one will not i feel sorry for you,0
  also there are persons who by reading tags c qt would immediately associate this question as a qt specific as ive said i feel sorry for you,0
how are you applying the expression please post your code also please clarify what you mean with but none of them seemed to work what exactly does not work what is the result you get d only matches a single digit 09 matches the whole string if it contains at least on digit it appears you want d,0
wellstay cool  jcrowder sorry if im not as good as you i failed  ok can i,0
this question should probably have the homework tag,0
  and all that vote down thank you for your down votes now i cant ask more questionsi dont understand why you think this question will not help future visitors i tryed to find the answer to my problem and couldnt find any so here it is if someone have the same problem in the future here is the answer the knowledge is so vast that no one knows everything and sometimes its the little things we do not know that make all the difference,0
formatting your code and data sure makes a difference we put effort into our answers for you please put some effort into your questions for us,0
please have a look at the faqhttpstackoverflowcomfaq on how to ask a good question and also maybe read this what have you triedhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
yes there is a way but youll need to show your actual html and javascript that youre trying to do this with were not going to write it for you,0
can you show us how did you assign the id to your tag,0
this question shows a huge lack of effort both in researching and phrasing without actual code,0
you have to be more specific how do you want to send it do you have an established connection with the server what protocol can it be socet or has to webservice,0
i hope you arent making something sneaky  like a virus,0
1 since no efforts made to search answer,0
what fiddle where exactly is the problem,0
still looking for possible description or even solution to this cause i do need that clean file hierarchy by pip but with setuppy way,0
  in what way is this incorrect just because pip expects a setuppy it does not mean that pip does not provide any other behaviour,0
dude you answer is just plain wrong and downvoting my answer wont change that,0
  how is my answer wrong the reason op does not get exactly the same behaviour from setuppy as from pip is because they are not the same programme nor are they supposed to be whether or not he could use some combination of switches to achieve that is irrelevant,0
  are you trolling,0
  are you im answering the question that was asked,0
  that still does not make my answer misleading as you so charmingly put it,0
  by strict literalism yes you have correctly answered the question but the details are relevant its pretty clear that the op wants some understanding of why they behave differently or a way to modify the behaviour of one its like answering why do i perceive red differently from blue with because theyre different colours correct but useless,0
  where would we be if we constantly asked trivial questions different things are different if op wants to know about the implementation he is free to look at the source,0
  youre trolling arent you,0
  certainly not are you trolling you are the one who is defending a question that amounts to why are two distinct things not the same,0
  in neither case does the mechanism answer the why question it amounts to a restatement of the fact that the programmeeye works in a particular way you are essentially complaining that i didnt make up a question that like more and choose to answer that,0
  the very fact that you identify three possible topics shows that all that can be provided is general information of some kind so is not about making up your own better question and answering it,0
  so is not about providing unhelpful overlyliteral answers to provide useful information we often have to infer a better question the vote counts on these answers suggest other users think that providing some useful information is better than a literal but unhelpful answer,0
  bzzzt thats an ad hominem thanks for playing,0
  i dont have to there are plenty of comments already fyi ive also flagged that for moderator attention as not an answer you keep using so answers to boost your ego wo any benefit to the community you will get downvoted,0

what have you tried are you getting errors do you have some code you can show please give examples of your array of words and your input string how it starts and what it should look like at the end,0
how big is your dataset that you need the fastest way to do it,0
we cant help you if you dont show what youve tried so far and what specific problems youre having,0
yes it is possible what have you tried google is your friend,0
people will only put effort into responses if you put effort into your question requests to write code your code will probably be ignored requests for help in a specific area or a specific sample would have a better chance of response,0
  considering his rep i think he just has not had his morning coffee yet,0
  oh dont judge people by their rep considering the code he have not a slightest idea what does his code do,0
this question isnt particularly well phrased  it took the comments on the answers to actually work out whats really being asked,0
i strongly suspect youve misdiagnosed the issue please show a short but complete program demonstrating the problem,0
your code the one you haven’t posted is almost comically wrong this is why it’s important that you post all the relevant code questions like this just waste everybody’s time,0
  i wonder how you can judge that is comical if you havent seen it if you dont know the answer to the question how to prevent optimization on a class field in c please feel free to not waste your time with it,0
what have you tried so farhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
facepalm its help with the code im asking for i have not written any code yet with this omg,0
very basic stuff 1 second google httpphpnetmanualenreservedvariablespostphp,0
what exactly are you asking,0
  then next time dont tag java,0
did you just list every language you know,0
if you want a generic solution theres an language agnostic tag you should be using,0
not just code explain what youre trying to do in code next the problem,0
i dont know what you are doing with your edits here you have added a huge block of code and other information twice once before it got reopened and then you removed it and added it back recently,0
   see the discussion here httpmetastackexchangecomquestions189591issosprogrammerssiteabetterplaceforadvancedquestions189595189595,0
what doesnt work what error do you get what have you done to troubleshoot this,0
this makes no sensereturns a constant if you initialize the variables and doesnt even compile because you use uninitialized variables,0
if the guy types in haha lol xd  then you should probably beat the crap out of him,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is toolocalised,0
did you try looking for loop javascrip or javascript interval  do it,0
come one whats the code youve attempted,0
good luck getting one  i would expect these to be totally identical,0
a logical explanation of what exactly why theyre nearly identical because theyre essentially the same comparison,0
this is horrible advice  and only artificially extends how many more fragments you can pack in  this problem still remains google explicitly states not to use this to address memory leaks,0
completely incorrect answer,0
yeah this doesnt work produces an exact duplicate of the gif,0
ive never seen a 23 answer before err sorry 24,0
unlucky the guys answer got accepted because that pins the answer up you often only see a few because they sink to the bottom pretty quickly so nobody pays attention to it ,0
whenever you learn a new language the first thing you should read are the operators read the reference before posting,0
very basic question that smells like homework,0
   you need to understand how to accomplish it someone else doing it wont help i really suggest pp  paper pencil,0
did you forget to have coffee today,0
please provide what you have tried so far,0
 is an unary operator socalled not do googling about c operators unarybitwise ones,0
yea wwwgooglecom,0
do some research before posting quest here,0
what help do you want and what have you tried,0
so what have you tried,0
and you want we create your code,0
no effort shown  no database mentioned,0
you could have easily got the answer by a simple google search  check this  httpwwww3schoolscomsqlsqltopasp,0
questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved include attempted solutions why they didnt work and the expected results,0
is that a question,0
lucky im not a compiler,0
you dont need to write the type down but if you cant figure it out on your own that just means you dont actually know what your program does,0
this code does not do any validation,0
thats the answer i gave 3 hours ago when you asked,0
still shouldnt be used at it looks horrible and devs maintaining your markup in the future will think its okay to reuse if youve used it  and they may not style out its inherent ugliness in practice its to be avoided,0
personally id avoid the thickness as it looks chunky,0
upvote means this question shows research effort it is useful and clear and at least 5 people on stackoverflow think this question meets that criteria,0
wait what you want me to help you steal a bunch of usernames and passwords,0
this isnt a place to have your script written for you search for perl open on how to open and read your file youll probably need some regexes to figure out whats a heading and whats a variable,0
why on earth are you doing three different queries to get data from your members table  youre selecting a field you already have in the first query some not necessarily related users encrypted password in the next query and then youre selecting every single userid in your members table,0
  its not really just a php thing its a working with relational databases thing and sort of a basic logic thing too  write out what you want your code to do verify that it makes sense and youre not adding a bunch of extra steps then write the actual code,0
what did you try,0
how is this parallel at all thats totally sequential i dont know why op accepted this as an answer,0
i dont see any question neither any description of what youve tried so far voting to close the question as not a real question,0
so is not your blog what does it mean to learn jquery before javascript that makes no sense,0
non sequitur  thanks,0
i think jquery is far more than just a javascript library no its just a library,0
we aint doing your homework for you show us your code explain what problem youre encountering and then we can help you,0
this answer doesnt absolutely reflect the point of question the asker wants no view controller,0
  i believe i already did globals are bad and what you have in your code are fancy globals i suggest you watch the videos in tereskos answer,0
just in case anyone reading this answer in the future thinks it is correct it is not mattmcdonalds answer is leaps and bounds better than this also never listen to w3schools they do not know what they are talking about and will misguide you,0
there are c to vbnet converters on the internet that can give you a big head start on a lot of this stuff,0
ok so youve told us the query and that you need help  neither of those things are questions whats the question what part are you having trouble with,0
welcome to so what have you tried please show you nonworking code and specify what is the current output and what is your desired output,0
have you considered hiring and paying a programmer,0
i am speechless,0
  google translate formats english in humanreadable format the grammar spacing is generally correct and it capitalises recognised nouns and the first word in a sentence the op may have used it to aid in his translations but he certainly didnt post its raw output,0

do your homework

have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question sharing your research helps everyone tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs this demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself it saves us from reiterating obvious answers and most of all it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer

swing does not support sleep  but it does allow for swing timers which is just as good if not better  nor does it allow you to parse ints in an event listener when the references come from an array  sorry but this is hogwash youve got a bug in your code if you need our help post the code and lets help you find your bug or you can rant your choice,0
ive tried to clean up the formatting now what the op must do is to debug the parse errors  to look and see exactly what each array item holds if it has an trailing or leading spaces punctuation or anything else that needs to be trimmed   you definitely have a bug in your code the parsing issue has nothing to do with swing and your posted code is helpful next time please follow our advice youve wasted at lot of time and our patience remember please that we are all volunteers,0
please tell me those are dummy names,0
rip naming conventions,0
so isnt a codewriting service could you demonstrate that youve at least tried something,0
try writing it yourself and folks here will be glad to help if you get stuck,0
  whats the point of giving an answer two an unclear question and then complaining about comments making exactly the assumptions you made for your “answer”,0
we still do not know the definition of man,0
you were hired as a web programmer at a company and you cant create a simple form with serverside code to send an email to a predefined address,0
i highly doubt your question is a good fit for this website please consult httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask being polite also helps,0
what have you researched yourself what exactly dont you understand as this is a fairly beginnerlevel question i assume youre learning from a good bookhttpstackoverflowcomq3882421782465 or tutorial how was it explained there and what parts of that explanation are unclear,0
by searching and remember the jvm doesnt know what vowel means youll have to write the algorithm yourself,0
at least try i can think of a million ways to do this,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because the question is overly broad and shows no evidence of prior effort,0
i like this kind of questions asap what you are willing to pay us,0
what have you tried so far stackoverflow is not for finding people to do your work but to help if youre stuck,0
it was a trivial question perhaps you can all go downvote this one too which has far less effort shown httpstackoverflowcomquestions1948152selectlast5elementswithjquery ,0
why would you post a response when youre not familiar with the topic,0
  why would you post a comment that isnt helpful at all to the question 15 years later,0
you are paroniac dude so far i have never downvoted anybody not just for this question,0
there are umptillion tutorials on the web that explain how css selectors work 1,0
like others would say rtfm  at least bother to lecture the basics before asking on so,0
  table returns more than 200 rows debugging for values for each row is almost impossible,0
debug 200 rows is almost impossible  almost as hard as formatting a question,0
you are totally wrong sorry,0
honestly the op does not demonstrate any effort to solve the questions on his own usually it is expected to introduce the problem in a clear and concise manner check and highlight the difficulties that have prevented from solving the problem himself not check,0
no body will answer this nor will iyou should start readingfor your reference httpideonecomq7zsme,0
please dont be so ridiculous with your edits it seems this question was mostly downvoted because of an unnecessary edit chain just leave it now will you,0
help with what youve only introduced your problem its like saying im maroun please help,0
google it you can find alot in stack overflow,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is about violating the tos of a third party site,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because this question is about violating the tos of a third party site,0
i am dead serious  you are saying that the code doesnt look right  so im asking what causes your suspicions  the code is syntactically correct although totally useless,0
this question is not what stackoverflow is for you should ask something that would help you not something about simple syntax how could anyone except php creator answer that if its correct  its correct,0
you have totally useless stuff with a right syntax the point that it does not make sense to you is right but you did not write a code to make sense for the computers  compiler i bet if they had an option to compile you  they would have thrown a null pointer exception on your brain,0
does swift have no documentation,0
alright easy now everybody i think 13 is more than sufficient,0
  i certainly wouldnt do it in production  for a dev box what does it matter its the easiest path to a reasonable facsimile of production,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because a simple attempt to run the code would have yielded the result,0
but you can try it for yourself observe the result and ask a question if the result is different  at which point your question can include the actual result alongside the reasoning for your expectation hint try reading the documentation for integerparseintstring first,0
  a word of warning  if you intend to become a professional programmer you are going to have to learn to look up documentation and to run programs if you want to know what happens when you run them your mother is not always going to be on hand to spoonfeed you your breakfast,0
no minimal research is done here,0
assuming this is homework namespace 1128 please show real effort and dont simply post the assignment i cant imagine what else the point of this assignment would be except to answer the question youre asking us,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because it does not appear to be asking about programming as defined by the help centerhttpstackoverflowcomhelp,0
this is a bad bad answer ,0
that first link is really a terrible terrible introduction to how to generate a normal distribution just awful and wrong please dont give it additional traffic by linking it,0
no  gaussian  randomnumber  sigma  median  this is completely wrong  unless randomnumber is gaussiannormal to start with,0
  please remove that gaussianrandomnumbersigmamedian equation it is hurting my eyes,0
why is this the accepted answer its factually wrong,0
this really stinks for    a few downvotes is not a big deal but because his incorrect answer was selected as the right answer his rep is taking a huge beating,0
and the documentation was no help here i rarely berate people for not googling but this would have been solved in 2 seconds by typing your title into a search engine,0
"  pieters removed comment 
my point was google it before you post here it takes me a great deal of effort and research before i post a question and id hope that others at least try to some extent",0
  absolutely and thats why this question is getting downvoted this much a quick google for perl time gave me the same info that ysth posted the op may need to pick up some more research skills first,0
oh man this is cleaner than anything i can think of  just hope some random copypaster from the interwebz doesnt shoot this directly into their console without looking at it ,0
study your math first then java,0
this is more a html question and a very silly mistake,0
did you read the code at all,0
its 2014 we can do better than this ,0
i would delete this answer to avoid the shame haha,0
error messages exist for a reason,0
  give me the reason and the solution to solve this problem ill give you a downvote instead,0
  so youre trying to learn c on the fly at a coding event oo,0
  yo welcome and never ask such type of silly questions its only making a junk in so,0
why dont you test yourself,0
try 10 as answer,0
this is not a site where we do your homework,0
consider taking a look at httpstackoverflowcomtour to learn how so works,0
whats wrong with that code you have there  its correct  that error you have provided is nonsense,0
  i rolled back you last change it invalidated the answer and your new question was only visible in the comment of the edit please accept the answer you received as it solved the problem you asked about if you have a new question ask a new question  not edit this one and maybe also learn how to ask good questions by reducing your code to an mcvehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,0
easy ton find on google ,0
you should really learn googleing and reading apis,0
we dont like screenshots without seeing how you created templist and on its hard to say whats wrong,0
i dont use classes or sprites or line breaks,0
  what exactly not working  post only the relevant part ,0
this hurts my eyes,0
too much code break it down,0
so many magic numbers,0
why even use java go straight to machine code,0
and the precision problems mentioned means that you cant use them as indexes the reasons really are endless you should dig into some computer history,0
really i mean by the time you wrote the question you could have done the calculation using your fingers,0
its funny how much attention this question is attracting,0
there are so many possibilties why not just use google or bing or whatever at first ,0
questions asking us to recommend or find a book tool software library tutorial or other offsite resource are offtopic for stack overflow,0
have you tried anything yet,0
dont bother it will be 76,0
this is not java,0
i hope you didnt write is less than,0
really none other than the ability to handle unicode in any encoding other than utf8 with all the performance issues with certain string operations that utf8 has or the fact that any desyncronisation between your string and your helper variable can lead to security issues,0
this answer is so wrong it makes me angry buffer overflows and encrypted data if nothing else,0
yes its a pithy and flippant answer that someone with nearly 60k reputation should know is unhelpful,0
the errors are quite selfexplanatory also please learn how to indent the code it will help a lot in the future,0
one think i am clear that your name is amol and no you havent spent two days for this problem,0
  you should try to find the solution yourself first this specific error is not rare especially when generated by the problem you have and if you rely on other people to tell you every time what to do its gonna be a long ride,0
  no this question is different it is still a bad question but different,0
in addition you might want to take a look at should hi thanks taglines and salutations be removed from postshttpmetastackexchangecomquestions2950shouldhithankstaglinesandsalutationsberemovedfromposts,0
what just execute your code in the else block,0
first of all fix your horrible formatting,0
sounds like a good question for your classmates or instructor your class is also a resource dont ignore it,0
this question has been asked many times before and you can find qhat you are looking for here there is no need to ask this question again,0
your code is unreadable bro,0
where did you get this code seems very strange code,0
from where you bring this code ,0
so is not a code writing service please show what you have tried and explain in what ways it does not work,0
this should be better,0
welcome to stack overflow you seem to be asking for someone to write some code for you stack overflow is a question and answer site not a codewriting service please see herehttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask to learn how to write effective questions,0
  dafuq really that doesnt make sense ,0
this is an incredibly bad researched question did you check the reference documentationhttpencppreferencecomwcppiocfprintf already what didnt you get from there,0
wouldnt a simple google search reveal this downvoting you can refer how to ask a question by checking httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask and how to create an example by reading this  httpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,0
  if you have not found on google that you can not create constructors outside a class you either didnt google at all or should really update both your knowledge of java and of howtogoogle,0
  this is not wrong  please read the question first  there is no reference to phone call,0
these are very basic rskills you will benefit a lot if you do some basic tutorials also taking some of your other questions into account in which you also have difficulties in very basic r operations,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because it appears to be too simple,0
did you thought through the code and algorithm,0
so is not a site for crowdsourcing your homework and i would like help is not a programming question,0
it this that homework again,0
go back and look at your notes read through your textbook and start working on it later if you have a specific question about something come back and ask and people will be a lot more willing to help you were not gonna do your homework for you,0
hi id strongly suggest that you had a look at the tourhttpstackoverflowcomtour to get a better idea of how so works so is not a teaching portal,0
this can easily be researched online question is far too broad as it stands for so,0
this is so well documented why are you fishing for reputation when you have so much already,0
come on you only need to try and compile that to know its not going to work,0
cant close this question as duplicate that is really poor,0
this is why i love stackoverflow my wife sometimes look at me awkwardly when i laugh while looking at code,0
what kind of sorcery is this please read how to askhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask page before asking any questions in the future please,0
who please dont come with question like that which will not serve to future user or current community,0
completely wrong,0
this is nonsense,0
does not work is not a technical term if you want to be a developer explain the problem in detail,0
next time post the real method instead of making it up from memory,0
pure codewriting requests are offtopic on stack overflow  we expect questions here to relate to specific programming problems  but we will happily help you write it yourself tell us what youve triedhttpwhathaveyoutriedcom and where you are stuck this will also help us answer your question better,0
  how about closing it as a dupe find all occurrences of a substring in pythonhttpstackoverflowcomq4664850 i will wait to hammer till i get your approval,0
you could have at least bothered to enter image description here as suggested,0
its something that you will find explained in every good c book,0
the question wasnt related in any way to this response this is a problem with kotlin as a language not kotlin on android and i think this is just sarcasm imho,0
  nevertheless posting his own answer after first trying to delete the question after taking advantange of diegos time makes him in4001 a bad actor,0
downvote reason so is not a write my code for me kind of website you should show your efforts,0
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

lol seriously",0
  this is a qa site not a qa site besideshttpblogstackoverflowcom201107itsoktoaskandansweryourownquestions,0
  theres nothing forbidden about answering your own questions although its not like this question has a lot of value its basic java syntax and people should have learned this during the first week of programming however it seems that a lot of the people dont bother reading the basic tutorials resulting in ridiculous questions,0
plus 1 for honestystraight as an arrow  havent tried anything,0
so its the second character now you could have mentioned that,0
  so whats the solution for that then,0
no it wont work,0
doesnt seem related to the question though,0
this has to be the weirdest answer i have ever seen,0
this is so basic i have to assume you did no research and made no effort to solve this yourself,0
  you seem be convinced that you know better than everyone out here then why are you asking no the result of s1concatdef wont go into the string pool and i cant understand what youre asking me,0
you did not receive attention because this question is totally opinion based as always every dev will call out for hisher favorite framework and you would have no more information at the end they can all do it but all requires a different level of expertise my suggestion would be  if you have expertise in any of those already go for it or try to get some expertise in the other and make the choice yourself based on what you can get from the different framework,0
this does not make any sense why would you want to convert an integer into a class they are two completely different types i propose you read about oo first,0
  you should consider changing your internship workplace,0
google for file io using c,0
i suggest studying c and then asking here this is way too basic and can be covered by any decent c book for beginners,0
your program wont even print anything until it has finished  almost forever and since you didnt initialise mpf it could print junk,0
rather that complaining about being required to write some text why not put some effort into writing a good question for example tell us what is project euler prob 3,0
 is usually called a colon not a double comma ive never heard it called anything but a colon but i dont know whether there are any regional differences ,0
theoretically it could be just as fast file a bug report to your cc compiler vendor please dont im being sarcastic,0
the question is a bit like asking why it takes longer to get your car out of the garage and drive to the corner shop than it does to walk,0
so how do you compile this nonsense c or c please first read about proper benchmarking there is more to doing it correctly than taking the time to loadexecuteterminate it,0
  i find this question quite terrible and the fact that you can write a nice bit of text doesnt redeem the question if you set me off on the right topic i might not need much prodding to rave on about it but that doesnt make the question any less lazy and misguided,0
  i guess i dont see it as much worse than some of the other dumb questions that get upvotes and involve serious misconceptions  i wish this had never been asked at all instead of being asked and then getting a notveryaccurate answer that misses the main reason for the observed behaviour  although the accepted answer does at least correct the misunderstanding that c is 2x slower than asm  inaccurate answers make me crazy,0
what else would you expect to happen if you do something twice it gets done twice,0
this function did exactly what i told it to do why did it do that basically,0
  as it looks right now any book would do well,0
outch a needless switch statement only to have it,0
probably trying to cheat his way through an interview test,0
using uppercase is considered screaming thus rude and impolite you are disrespecting this community you see this is not a place where you drop your requirements and other people do the thinking for your,0
delete this ans,0
this really looks like some lastminute panic on your homework,0
you say you cant use group by because your instructor said so but that youre doing this exercise for your own practice how does that work,0
what are you trying to do and why would you want to do it this way  this is not cleaver coding clever coding is doing the minimum possible to achieve the result in this case cout   2  4    24 would  work  maybe you could look at templates they might suit your needs better,0
i did get a good chuckle out of this answer,0
well it is correct in the wrong way,0
damn dont work as admin if you dont need to,0
wtf is this how do you end up in your system32 folder,0
this ones by far the most downvoted answer i have seen  lollol,0
this is a god like answer  he is far further along than any of us in terms of programming  none of us can understand,0
because it doesnt support it its like asking why an automobile cant fly also your example usage is nonsense,0
looks like you are trying to hack something,0
before adding a bounty to your question at least go through the motion of making it a real question no one has any real idea as to what youre actually after my intuition is that this is an xy problemhttpmetastackexchangecomquestions66377whatisthexyproblem please clean up your question see to the help centerhttpstackoverflowcomhelp for further reference,0
this definitely smacks of an xy question could the poster provide any type of background about why the artificial constraints hes imposed are practical in some way,0
why does the output include apple and not include mango  why does the output not include the new first column  where did the 0 in the example output come from  why is a row with 456 chosen when neither such row contains purchased  in other words your desired output doesnt bear any obvious relation to the conditions specified in the question or the sample input data,0
 sorry the desired output was correct but i was wrong with the run command which i have changed now the nulls are replaced as zero let me know if you can help me now ,0
within a selection  what selection a range in a worksheet that has the worksheet names the selected worksheets what do you mean by that also what have you tried  so is not a code writing service let us know what youve tried what failed any error messages etc and we can help you we dont tend to write from scratch,0
  many have come here to help we cannot do such with the information given there are too many possible answers  brucewayne and matthewd are two of the best at doing this  when they asked question to clarify your question you assumed you knew more  your assumptions about us are such a generalization that it begs the question why we would ever help  many of us work in the it and many others do not  we are a large community that i am sure include ceos to street sweepers  we do this not for the glory but to help  your attitude is uncalled for,0
heres how you select a worksheet worksheetssheetnameselect if its in a range for each cel in rng worksheetscelvalueselect next cel except i have a feeling thats not what you want if you cant be helpful for us we cant help you you say youve looked thoroughly  where have you looked this kind of thing is something that is used all the time and you should be able to find ample resources  can you please post in your op what youve tried how it worked differently from what you expect and please expand on what you mean by selecting a worksheet in a range,0
learning c from videos seems to be error prone well i never tried so being educating myself old school ways from books and practising but your track seems to be a weak one,0
there is no way that you couldnt find the answer to this by google searching,0
people think you didnt google hard enough,0
the downvotes are mainly because you didnt read google or even bother to provide in the question the error message,0
youve got 72 rep points  and so surely you know how to post well formatted code by now right you also know that if code is well formatted it is more easily understood right,0
the scope of any exam is to test your knowledge of the topic asking an urgent or lastminute question on so defiles that scope plus your question isnt fit for so anyway for many reasons see herehttpstackoverflowcomhelp,0
this is going to be a gone case,0
i would like an advancement payable to me asap if i answer this simple question for you what have you actually done and or tried also please read the following how to ask a questionhttpstackoverflowcomquestionsask,0
this does not make any sense what are you  trying to achieve,0
   apparently it does not make any sense to a few other people as well,0
nay alas you have to solve your homework on your own we all had to go through that ,0
share your code and we can help you with some guidelines nobody here will do the homework for you,0
its sort of an if you have to ask youre not yet ready to know question but basiles answer has some splendid arrows in the right direction to me the real question is not so much why you thought basic types and keywords were defined anywhere but specifically why you in stdioh,0
does that question indeed poorly asked deserve so many downvotes,0
hint if you tell people not to downvote the question lots of them will do exactly that plz do not downvote is a cue that the question probably needs to be downvoted either way that is just noise that does not belong in a question i have edited it out here and otherwise improved the clarity of your question please do not add it back in there is nothing you can do about how people decide to vote if the question is useful and clear you will generally get more upvotes than downvotes which makes up for it in the end complaining about it in the comments is also discouraged,0
questions asking us to recommend or find a book tool software library tutorial or other offsite resource are offtopic for stack overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam instead describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it,0
please take the tour and visit ask as well as the checklisthttpmetastackoverflowcomquestions260648stackoverflowquestionchecklist your question isnt particular well asked and deserves a better title after that i guess it is also a duplicate,0
you should go back some lessons and learn the meaning of main and executables your code contains nothing but implementations of how to do something but actually does nothing,0
  see all the functions you wrote none of them are ever being executed because youre not calling them anywhere,0
yeah there is something off about this question,0
i did go and read the whole thing like you said and indeed i wept but mainly at the stupidity of felix which i dont think was what you were trying to get across,0
you seem very resolute on your stance concerning the standard being broken may i ask if you have a defect report on the way,0
  its integer overflow it happens obviously it is wrong for the compiler to assume that it doesnt its that assumption which is wrong not the fact that the call removed was an assert it should not be ub at all it should be defined to either wrap 2scompliment or trap and those are the only sensible things for a compiler to do assuming it cant happen in 2015 when all know it is a major source of security bugs is not innocent nor even stupid its malice,0
anybody who is pitying safety versus performance should just switch to java,0
downvoted for the useless rant they are  introducing bugs on purpose perhaps for a foreign government really this isnt rconspiracy,0
  you have to stop thinking these things are accidents havent you been paying attention two  thats two  unknown parties subverted juniperos we kind of assume one was the nsa but who was the other,0
decent programmers over and over again repeat the mantra do not invoke undefined behaviour yet these nonks have gone ahead and done it anyway and look what happened i have no sympathy whatsoever this is the developers fault simple as that they need to take responsibility remember that personal responsibility people relying on your mantra but what about in practice is precisely how this situation arose in the first place avoiding nonsense like this is precisely why standards exist in the first place code to standards and you wont have a problem period,0
they dont read the compiler release notes they assume the compiler writer is on their side and if they work for me they are subsequently fired for gross incompetence seriously who calls themselves a programmer yet doesnt bother to read release notes when they upgrade their entire toolchain to a new major revision defending that behaviour with the ridiculous the standard is wrong is just absurd is the c standard perfect absofrickinglutely not but its right in this case and even if it werent your rationale is mortifyingly flawed,0
  im amazed nobody stepped in to tell felix to calm down what a douche nine years on i wonder where he is now,0
it goes against the c groupthink but this is the only correct answer to this question  they just dont care about whether they break existing widelyused previouslyworking code and the c community is too broken to recognize that,0
with all due respect i would put money on the bug being with your code and not the compiler,0
your program seems to have a split personality disorder it cant decide whether its c or c,0
  be as harsh as you want but my point still stands  its much more likely for a problem to be with your own code than with the compiler and its a mark of inexperience to assume the opposite,0
  dont ge me wrong i am definitely not saying the problem is from the compiler then you should change your question title to something more meaningful also provide a mcve including a detailed description of the problem and what you did observe when stepping through your program code with the debugger after you did all that you probably solved your problem without asking here at all,0
asked thousand times google your title which you should have done before youve asked this,0
then you need to work on your googling skills  i feel like i see this question asked and closed as a dupe every other day,0
   yes and the answer is there are too many people who dont know how to research  once a question as simple to find as this has been asked once it should not be asked again,0
frustating is to see people who dont care to invest a minimum effort on research,0
googled first buddy,0
in general we want you to post a selfcontained question  giving us the link to buy the book on amazon really doesnt cover the required background  i expect that youre not allowed to post the applicable material from the book as a result this question wont be appropriate for stackexchange,0
probably this is referring to a different context than the one you think it refers to wtf alex,0
this site is not for interview us,0
i guess im committing some capital sin here can anyone please explain which,0
your question is so vague and open ended that youd have attracted close votes but a question with a bounty cant be closed so you get downvotes instead,0
youre essentially asking stackoverflow users to write code for your specific use case on their own time if you cant figure out those academic papers hire someone who can,0
you dont provide much enough information in my opinion my first thought was convolution but if it doesnt need to be that precise then just a simple high pass filter to find the words and gaps may be adequate the negativity may be that it isnt a programming question co much as a signal analysis question and by making it a programming question it comes across as write my code,0
also so is not a forum,0
hey girl with pearl earring  you could possibly ask a question like this on the gamedevcom site where general techniques can be discussed  quite simply this site is for asking about specific bugs in code this site has nothing to do with general technique discussion  so find the better site to ask your question on,0
this is insane,0
somebody had a bad day  its true there are many situations where bypassing certificate validation is useful,0
wrt if i ever notice that that question has been reopened then i will delete this copy and reproduce my answer there what are you going to do if the answer you should end up accepting isnt yours,0
  i dont see a problem what are you imagining,0
  someone posts a bright shining solution to this question the old question gets reopened so you copy your solution into the old question and delete this question and said bright shining solution to the original question is gone from posterity i didnt downvote this btw,0
  i dont follow is this a complaint about me chasing points i have updated the original question to improve the english but i still cant post a solution there that doesnt seem to be how so wants to work there is also a commandline solution as well as my own win all round,0
  its not a complaint about anything i was simply asking what youre going to do with answers this question receives other than your own ifwhen the old question is reopened and you delete this question after duplicating your own answer under the old question  are you going to contact the other posters of answers to move their answers from here to the old question and wait for that to happen before you close this question or are you going to copy their answers into yours in the old question with some accreditation comment or do nothing or something else,0
please learn how to ask questions on so,0
you do not seem familiar with the c language at all i would suggest you at least get the basics before trying to implement anything  you will save time,0
a few syntax error first i see whilekvpkey  kvpkey 10  kvpkey  20 should be whilekvpkey  kvpkey 10  kvpkey  kvpkey  20 this would be syntactically correct but semantically nonsense a value can´t be equal its value 10,0
this is my code but i get an error  do we have to beg for you to tell us what the error is,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because so is no homework service,0
so is not a personal service for your homework,0
and people in hell want ice water whats your point questions should be posed in the form of a question,0
before raising an question try to search in google you can get a lot of stuff,0
did you google it you will get lot of results also did you try to read official docs and why jdk 5 now its old,0
his teacher may not have told him about contains yet,0
for the sake of your next issues on php try to type your intent on google followed by the word php and i swear you wont be regret theres plenty of material starting with its official documentation that covers every single bundled function for array purposes if you cant find your answers at all then you can consider asking here at so since a research effort has been made before it,0
not a good option as this is not a standard interchange format,0
too poor answer i think this is a bad option because dont use or implement a standar,0
may i just say you are tenacious keeping an answer posted with a current score of 15 that has collected 23 downvotes  i didnt downvote btw,0
because your question deserves them you have int32 c  converttoint32mathsqrtc2 and asking what happened to my decimal fraction needs down votes,0
the whole point of the teacher assigning this exercise is for you to figure it out on your own by studying the rules of operator order and precedence getting us to explain it to you defeats the purpose,0
homeworkassignment trash,0
this should be asked to iso not to so,0
