GlobalTM(x) and [GlobalRM(x) * (GlobalSHM(x) * GlobalSM(x))] separately.\n    GlobalM(x) = GlobalTM(x) * [GlobalRM(x) * (GlobalSHM(x) * GlobalSM(x))];\n\n    InhereitType = RrSs:\n    GlobalRM(x) * (GlobalSHM(x) * GlobalSM(x)) = GlobalRM(P(x)) * LocalRM(x) * [GlobalSHM(P(x)) * GlobalSM(P(x))] * LocalSM(x);\n\n    InhereitType = RSrs:\n    GlobalRM(x) * (GlobalSHM(x) * GlobalSM(x)) =

LocalTWithAllPivotAndOffsetInformationV(x) = Local(x).GetT();\n    GlobalTV(x) = GlobalM(P(x)) * LocalTWithAllPivotAndOffsetInformationV(x);\n\n    Notice: FBX SDK does not support shear yet, so all local transform won't have shear.\n    However, global transform might bring in shear by combine the global transform of node in higher hierarchy.\n    For example, if you scale the parent by a non-uniform scale and then rotate the child node, then a shear will\n    be generated on the child node's global transform.\n    In this case, we always compensates shear and store it in the scale

Unfortunately, rather than protect the users from these problems, the GCC developers have chosen to use undefined behaviour as an excuse to implement marginal optimisations, even when it has been clearly explained to them how harmful it is.</p>\n\n<p>Here a much cleverer person than I explains in great detail. (He's talking about C but the situation is the same there).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!msg/boring-crypto/48qa1kWignU/o8GGp2K1DAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!msg/boring-crypto/48qa1kWignU/o8GGp2K1DAAJ</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Why is it harmful?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Simply recompiling previously working, secure code with a newer version of the compiler can introduce security vulnerabilities</strong>. While the new behaviour can be disabled with a flag, existing makefiles do not have that flag set, obviously. And since no warning is produced, it is not obvious to the developer that the previously reasonable behaviour has changed.</p>\n\n<p>In this example, the developer has included a check for integer overflow, using <code>assert</code>, which will terminate the program if an invalid length is supplied. The GCC team removed the check on the basis that integer overflow is undefined, therefore the check can be removed. This resulted in real in-the-wild instances of this codebase being re-made vulnerable after the issue had been fixed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30475\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30475</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read the whole thing. It's enough to make you weep.</p>\n\n<h3>OK, but what about this one?</h3>\n\n<p>Way back when, there was a fairly common idiom which went something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code> OPAQUEHANDLE ObjectType::GetHandle(){\n    if(this==NULL)return DEFAULTHANDLE;\n    return mHandle;\n\n }\n\n void DoThing(ObjectType* pObj){\n     osfunction(pObj-&gt;GetHandle(), \"BLAH\");\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the idiom is: If <code>pObj</code> is not null, you use the handle it contains, otherwise you use a default handle. This is encapsulated in the <code>GetHandle</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>The trick is that calling a non-virtual function doesn't actually make any use of the <code>this</code> pointer, so there is no access violation. </p>\n\n<h2>I still don't get it</h2>\n\n<p>A lot of code exists which is written like that. If someone simply recompiles it, without changing a line, every call to <code>DoThing(NULL)</code> is a crashing bug - if you are lucky. </p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are not  lucky, calls to crashing bugs become remote execution vulnerabilities.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This can occur even automatically. You've got an automated build system, right? Upgrading it to the latest compiler is harmless, right? But now it's not - not if your compiler is GCC.</p>\n\n<h2>OK so tell them!</h2>\n\n<p>They've been told.
