an official tutorial is at httpdocsoraclecomjavasetutorialjavajavaoo ,1
an introductory tutorial on java would be a good place to start  interviewers can usually tell if youve never used the technology for which theyre interviewing before,1
maybe the hr just wanted to check your creativity applied to java language,1
i dont think there is a right answer for that,1
because 0 evaluates to false in boolean contexts,1
because 0 is falsey,1
for compatiblity with c 0 is implicitly convertible to false and nonzero is implicitly convertible to true,1
i is the same as i  0 in a boolean expression,1
use for int i  3 empty i to have infinite loop,1
or whiletrue cout  i    if you want to keep the while loop,1

indexofobject,1
how is this the opposite of get,1
suggest you read the javadocs for list httpsdocsoraclecomjavase8docsapijavautillisthtml  should be obvious,1
are you asking how to get index position of that element in your list,1
  with get you input the index and it outputs the object with indexof you input the object and it outputs the index,1
oh ok  in that sense,1
just for the sake of correctness if your objects start as  they are probably lists and not arrays,1
where did you get stuck with this,1
read up on zip and for loops,1
print each name with a number  enumerate,1
not sure how to print each name with each numbers from the lists for example the first name is test and the first number 1 is 5 then the first number2 is 20 i want that all on one line for each one in the lists,1
if you read how to ask a good questionhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask you may see that is asks you to create a mcve you should show your csv data how you read it into your lists then your expected output what does test 5 20 mean,1
test the name i said that already 5number1 20number2 all of which is inside the list from the csv file,1

yeah you missed the part where your statment question exlusivly refered to a singleton,1
the answer does not say such a thing private constructors are merely a way of enforcing the singleton pattern you only cheat it by having your main inside that class,1
making the constructor private is one of the things you need to do to implement the singleton pattern but its not the only thing and just this by itself does not automatically make it a singleton,1

the condition i  100 is false it should be i  100,1
  why,1
yes one person give the correct information so go with  ,1
  the loop executes as long as the condition is true i  100 is not true when the loop starts so it doesnt execute,1
  you have a backward understanding of how the condition works its not the test for when the loop should stop its the test for when the loop should keep repeating,1
the random numbers are irrelevant youd have the same problem with echo foo,1
  that makes more sense thanx,1
  i didnt understand because i asked this question yesterday linkhttpstackoverflowcomquestions40008544whycanthesecondforloopargumentnotbeequaltonumber4000858140008581 and was given a wrong answer i suppose,1

i am working on something similar are you going to store values per dom element or for the whole page as a total a simple implementation of color changing can be found here prodevsiteadmin click the logo to open the menu and from the settings you can quickly change page color perhaps creating a json settings file per user having the values of the colorsfont etc to store to database would be a good idea you could then pass the json to some javascript functions that will make the appropriate changes and complete the magic,1

why use a regex when sstrip does exactly this,1
sstrip only handles the initial white space but not whitespace discovered after removing other unwanted characters note that this will remove even the whitespace after the final leading n,1
someone downvoted this answer but didnt explain why it is flawed shame on you   if the down vote was you please reverse as i explained your question and you didnt mention anything actually broken with my answer,1
rafe you might want to doublecheck sstrip produces precisely the same result as your regex,1

you said numbers like what other forms should be accepted is 123 number valid or should it be 12300 is 1234500 valid or 01 do you want to accept only two decimal places or can it change,1
yes number u have mentioned are valid  ,1
update your post to include rules you use to decide what is valid and what is not,1
yes number u have mentioned are valid i also mentioned 1234500 which has four digits after  so can we assume that  can have any number of digits after it like 12345600 would such number be valid or there is some rule which invalidates it if so what rule is it,1
  123400 is not validmy current rule is i just want only one decimal value and accept commain text field,1
  only one digit and one comma,1

   multiple comma,1

i dont understand your question  please edit your question and instead show us sample input and output in tabular form each line indented by 4 spaces to format it as code,1
whats your question,1
i have a string  to  my address  and 3 values in a separate table i need to replace these value by key my first value is 10 so the first key get replaced with 10 10 to  my address  and such,1
please provide a small sample so we are clear on exactly what you mean appears like you can just split up the values and add them to the key but i would like a small sample to verify everything works as intended,1
what dialect of sql are you using  add a tag for that as well,1

where did the string come from it could be easier to check each character as the text comes in rather than all at once afterwords,1

it’s c use stdstring,1
  were you thinking about stdistreamiteratorchar and stdallof,1
note that c doesnt guarantee the character set that will be used,1
load the allowed characters as keys of an unorderedmap then query each candidate character if a char is not in the unorderedmap then an unallowed character is present and process accordingly,1

why are you using typeidname what exactly is it you want to achieve,1
code is tagc why the tagc tag,1
unclear what youre asking i also feel wrong with assigning a pointer to array,1
is it possible to define your own variable type and then use it as any other variable well thats one of the purposes of c,1
can you show the code that you would like to write as it stands the question is completely unclear,1
  thats initializating a char array from a string literal that does not exceed the size of the array not assignment it is valid,1
the whole point of struct is to define your own types so you are pretty much asking if you can define your own types without doing what is required to define your own type,1
what typeidaname returns is not defined by c it is down to the compiler writers it can be different for every compiler,1
you have it in my answer ,1
oh nice thanks,1
yeah i dont want to use stuct doesnt look good then use a language whose syntax suits you better aesthetically,1
  in c userdefined types are introduced with keyword class struct or union its unclear what you dont like about them and what youre actually trying to achieve if you explain better what doesnt look good means there might be a way to answer you,1
stdstring is a class just like your struct,1
heres a novel idea dont actually send the email until its ready to be sent just store it somewhere until its ready,1
ok i am not asking anybody to do my job just asking if there is anybody that has done something like what i am asking the reason i posted the question is because looking here httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysystemnetmailsmtpclientvvs110aspx there is no onsend or beforesend or something like that the smtpclient class only provides sendcompleted event,1
"youll need a way to intercept the message first how is the message being sent can you host a smart relay that does this do you need to program something new to do it or do any existing tools already perform this functionality there are lots of smart smtp servers out there

what exactly is the question again",1
  and joedm i just edited the question hope it is clear now,1
incidentally i assume that this is an email client you wrote or otherwise control the code of or are you trying to do an outlook plugin or something like that this is a very different question if youre trying to do this with a third party tool like outlook,1
also do you control the smtp servers,1
i have already done a plugin for outlook that does the same very big difference is that outlook object model do expose an itemsend event that allows me to cancel the sending operation i am trying to generalize the solutions to all mail clients that is why i ran into this and no i do not have any control on the smtp server,1

parameterized queries minimizes sql injection when cmdexecutenonquery executes  the injection often occurs when using concatenated values in a query string what exactly youve tried to do,1
try executing your command maybe something will happen,1
you form the command just fine but never execute it,1
like   suggested your code doesnt run the command which is why you get no errors becuase it doesnt actually do anything to return an error,1
  and how do i use that would be nice if you could help me,1
there is a typo in  ,1

"you could create an infinite loop package but ssis packages can be resource intensive if left to run forever

i would consider creating an agent job that runs every x secondsmins that checks for changes in the file and if there is a change to execute the package",1
you could try a script task that looks at the file systems info on the csv file you coudl count the rows in the csv file as a first step you coudl check the data against ids already held in your sql server table this is not a code problem as such its more that you are looking to learn ssis,1
please mention your table name or tried code,1

please be so kind and provide more information about your table structure,1
dontr spam tags c is a different language,1
youd find it easier and more maintainable to do this with structs,1
preferably trying to avoid structs and do it without them   ,1
  that is not valid c code anyway there is no position 1 or 0 the code is plain wrong,1
you really shouldnt be doing this but you can subtract the correct value from the char to get the right number like if you cast  char 0 to int then itll be a number specifically 48 so if you do int 048 youll get back a number,1
  avoiding structs solely for learning purposes  ,1

   cursor  collectionfindarraycategory filter 

   foreach cursor as document 
    valumongodbbsontojson document
    
    echo jsonencode valu

i got this response from php i want to create json object in android to use this json  ,1
in two cases youre returning a pointer that doesnt come from malloc,1
πάνταῥεῖ this question use method so this is c,1
you want to return null in case something went wrong and not a pointer to an unfreeable string literal like you do here return charmalloc,1
well to be fair im not doing anything with the return  charmalloc its just there for completeness it hangs after the very first call which returns the string succesfully but then hangs on freeidqueuestring,1
by the way this is very bad cast because you remove the read only attribute of char const ,1
why does it matter i only added that in the code for my question it actually returns null in my code and should never actually reach that address because i only use 5248 bits of ram out of 128kb,1
  you also have a code path that does returnstring  charempty i suggest you use a debugger to find your bugs,1
how am i not returning a pointer can you potentially tell me what its actually returning because it sure looks like a pointer returnstring to me,1
oh interesting i had a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of casting to char then what is a minimal way for doing the empty line i have it as a series of returnstringqueuelength  e  returnstringqueuelength  0 and that seems pretty cumbersome in terms of number of lines of code,1
also why did people vote my question down lol,1
doing strcpyreturnstring empty will copy the string literal to the char array you allocated that will fix a single problem you probably still need to take a careful look at the rest of your code,1
people vote your question down maybe because you dont provide a code that can reproduce you problem best to have mcvehttpsstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,1
  whats wrong with the rest of it sorry and yea im tired on a saturday night guess that was the obvious answer ,1
  im just being overly cautious based on this very small sample you might have similar issues elsewhere,1
"its the only function that returns a pointer ive monitor  memory and it remains static when external inputs are removed its in an electronics environment ive been able to predictably increase bit usage by stimulating the appropriate channels also i followed the entire program around through assembly and this was the only issue i encountered

why people have downvoted and voted to close my question is it not a valid question if someone has a misunderstanding of the language they use and make a mistake does that mean their question is worth removing so hostile",1
it has been already noted that you should provide a mcve your apparent reluctance to do so is likely the cause of down votes,1
the files required to compile for my embedded device number in the thousands i cant post that here,1
why would you expect it to return true,1
what number do you expect  or  to represent,1
also you should be using doubleparse or tryparse instead of converttodouble,1
whats the actual problem you are trying to solve here,1
i think this is a case for regex,1
you know the first character is x assuming these are always xy  z coordinates it should be simple to substring out the numeric information using indexof with substring or with a regularexpression,1
typing incompatible type cannot convert int to string on google would probably lead you to an answer if not reading some bookguidedoc would for sure,1
where exactly do you think this would happen why,1
i dont see anything wrong with this code can you post the whole console output,1
it doesnt give that error because the only int in that code the 3 in new string3 really does need to be an int no such conversion is needed,1
what you mean by int,1
this is not a number,1
its not integer  you cant,1
you really want to convert an image to int,1
you only want the numbers thats what you mean,1
if you want to convert part do split and convert,1

this is off topic it has nothing to do with the behavior of rand the latter is supposed to provide normally distributed set  of values any arithmetic operation on the result of it should provide a random result  is such an operation,1
its not off topic as it is in fact literally a portion of the problem at hand everybody is looking at rand without troubleshooting if modulomodulus  is a potential cause whilst you might recognize the flaw people who come across this topic who dont know what  actually does would have zero reference material to confirm themselves what the bug is i dont mind a 0 score but dont down vote my answer as irrelevant since it is relevant,1

you need to assign the input to a variable i assume scnextline returns a string so you need a string variable to assign that return value to,1

will you need to input a series of dance steps  that is will there ever be multiple lines giving d1 through dn,1
no it will always be one line the set of dance moves repeats supposedly infinitely many times,1
the output here will be 3 because there will always be people in spaces 1 2 and 3 no because with your current example the result is 3 after the first time the sequence is executed but becomes 2 after the second time the sequence is executed after that it stays constant at 2,1
say the order of the people before any execution is just 1 2 3 4 then after one execution according to the mapping above i think it should become 2 3 1 4 empty subsequently following the same mapping it becomes 3 1 4 2 empty and so on this is my understanding of the problem however the inputoutput above is provided spots 13 are always occupied,1
well first of all the numbers in your example input and your subsequent analysis dont line up but if i go with your example input lets say that initially theres one person on every position 1 1 1 1 after iteration one this becomes 1 2 1 0 after iteration two this becomes 2 2 0 0 subsequent iterations no longer change this result,1
yes sorry i just realized this and i have edited the question you are correct that for the example input the answer should have been 2 now updated to match analysis,1
same scenario for the new example input 1 1 1 1  2 1 1 0  3 1 0 0 then stabilizes,1
do the numbers represent the number of people on the corresponding index here if so it should be 1 1 1 1  1 1 2 0  2 1 1 0  1 1 2 0,1
are you talking about the result after every move or after every full sequence of moves,1
the full sequence of moves the last index in the example no longer be mapped after the first iteration since nobody is occupying that spot,1
then i dont see how you get to those results if we look at the execution of the steps in only the first sequence i have 1 1 1 1  0 1 2 1  0 1 2 1  2 1 0 1  2 1 1 0 so i dont see how you get to 1 1 2 0 after the first iteration,1
i am getting 1 1 1 1  1 1 2 0 each person is mapped to the corresponding index in 3 2 1 3 which means that the first index in 1 1 1 1 goes to index 3 the second one goes to index 2 and the third one goes to index 1 the last one also goes to index 3 since there is no 4 in the dancing moves array nothing is mapped to the last index in the array which means that it is at zero,1
think you missed a part in your assignment this means that they will move together for the rest of the remaining dances,1
hmm the example inputoutput i have currently in op is provided to me with output of 3 i believe that after arriving at 1 1 2 0 it follows 3 2 1 3 again the first index 1 is mapped to the 3rd index the second index also 1 is mapped to the second index the third index 2 is mapped to the first index since there is nobody at the last spot it cannot be mapped which gives 2 1 1 0 no matter how many times the people follow this set of dance moves the first three places remain occupied i think that all of the mappings be thought of as instantaneously occuring,1
hmmmm that changes things wouldnt the solution then just always be arraysstreammovesdistinctcount,1
a counterexample n  4 dancing moves  1 1 2 3 here the we would have the sequence 1 1 1 1  2 1 1 0  3 1 0 0  4 0 0 0 so the output would be 1 whereas the line of code outputs 3,1
i think that your idea of snapshotting might work what if every snapshot were stored into an array or something and once we get a snapshot that we have already arrived at we can conclude that it has stabilized it will begin to cycle then then we can count the number of nonzero elements and that should be the answer,1

dictionarystring liststring may work one key to a list value this wont look like your expected tho,1

would multiple savecontactmethodfoo be even valid json if that is what you want,1
   its a valid json but it produce warning warningduplicate key names should be unique,1
  i was thinking the same thing thats not valid json because you have duplicate property names,1
 balamanigandan so its not valid json then,1
   warning is different than error the said format is a valid json,1
does not work key value would never have duplicate key if you can have duplicate key use of keyvaluepair is meaning less,1
   yeah i need a better solution for this anyone please assist me,1
dictionarystring liststring would be what you need as initially mentioned,1
maybe you need to talk to your client and explain to them this is a stupid requirement likely to introduce all sorts of problems down the road,1
yes technically that is valid json however its meaning according to the spec is that preceding duplicate keys are ignored hence the warnings in your online tools the json is invalid if you care about the integrity of your data since you do care about the integrity you can no longer call it json its now your own custom format that happens to resemble json,1
   here the question is returning json with duplicate keys not for parsing first try to understand the requirement of the question then reply,1

theres nary a char in the code you show i for one have no idea what you are talking about why again is it surprising that a function with return type of int can return a value of type int,1
a is an int the function is returning an int would you still think a was a char if you changed its name to aaaaa,1
generally speaking arent az characters,1
isnt a also a variable in python,1
a is a char but a is not try return a or replacing int a with char a and see how far you get,1
 ưuvĩnhphúc what do you mean by that a can be used as a variable but by default a is not defined,1
  yes i mean it can be used as an identifier in python just like in c and it cant be a character in python,1
i mistakenly thought this was a meaningful question and voted to reopen i just took the ops assertion about the function and didnt read the code ,1
and it cant be a character in python  yes it can a is perfectly valid python expression,1
  of course its a valid python express just like its a valid c expression because its a valid identifier but its not a valid character string how do you print a and expecting it to print the letter a to console without setting a  a first,1

you do not have a return 0 statement at the end of main  how is main going to return anything without a return statement,1
nonvoid functions must return something,1
  main has an implicit return 0,1
  in c main will implicitly return 0 if no return statement is encountered its a rule unique to main,1
the programm compiles with no errors  but i bet you had warnings about returning nothing from a function that is supposed to return something like your setweaponname function  the code asis invokes undefined behavior due to this issue,1
  while true by pointing that out to a novice programmer you are encouraging sloppy programming  if the desire is for a value to be returned it should be explicitly done and not rely on implicit behavior  implicit behavior can come later when the program actually works,1
i put return 0 on main and a return to the other fuctions but i have still the same problem,1
  bs theres nothing sloppy about omitting a return 0 from main if you actually write return 0  id have to ask if you knew what you were doing you are actually confusing a new comer by implying main needs an explicit return statement and that their code is faulty for not having it,1
once i clean up all of the setter functions that return nothing by replacing the return type with void i get a tonne of errors good odds that all of the invalid functions confused the heck out of the  compiler and produced a completely batsmurf program,1
put return 0 on main and a return to the other functions but i have still the same problem  without changing what i mentioned those problems will remain,1
  its a necessary requirement for the homework to put setters and getters,1
just remember that there is almost never a reason for a setter function to have to return anything,1
whole bunch of free functionshttpsstackoverflowcomquestions4861914whatisthemeaningofthetermfreefunctioninc accessing private class members you cant do that,1
  well its silly you should ask whoever set those requirements and see if they come back with something better than the usual its good practice nonsense,1
recommendation dont write so much code at a time write a few lines maybe a function then compile if you have enough to test test it but do not proceed until you have no compiler errors no compiler errors and your testing finds no bugs if you let any of these build up they tend to interact with one another making it harder to sort out whats a real bug and whats an artifact of another bug,1
what do you mean by returns 3221225477 the program prints that thats the exit code i notice 3221225477 is 0xc0000005  that might mean something,1
here is a working code  cppsh46j35 the main and only problem was with your setters return type should be void  i have no idea why that even compiled,1
tactical point expanding on   s comment if a variable has a getter and a setter and the setter does nothing to protect the variable from someone injecting a bad value you might as well make the variable public and remove the setter and getter setters are all about the object protecting itself if its not protecting itself the setter is just more code that can have a bug in it,1
  i didnt write all in once but khow i put the duelforyoungsamurais or the pickweapon parts in comment and i have the same problem,1

somehow that mass of nonreturning functions that should be returning  successfully hides a raft of coding mistakes that are errors in gcc 485 and 492 no idea how,1

heres something i didnt see earlier  friend string duelforyoungsamuraissamurai a samurai b but duelforyoungsamurais is defined as void duelforyoungsamuraissamurai a samurai b since the return types are different they arent the same function so  the implementation of duelforyoungsamurais cannot access the private members,1
  the code contains no pointers no arrays no calls to new etc  so the only thing i can see that would cause it to not work is and this is the third time mentioning this  your functions that are marked as returning string that fail to return a string are the most likely cause for the errors  playing around commenting out things is not going to fix that problem  either make those functions void or return a string,1

look up arraymap in the php manual,1
sigh is 15843 a string or an array are you wanting to convert it to the string 15843 or an array containing 1 5 8 4 3,1
  15849 is a string and i wanting it to the string 15843,1

i am downvoting this because the question doesnt include any code showing the problem among other reasons,1
im still willing to help,1
  thank you its an assignment  also im not allowed to use structures or classes for the program,1
  code is in the link to the paste bin what other reasons,1
"i cleaned up the formatting a bit including for the code  follow the pattern for indenting that i used in main to make the code more readable  that might help remove some of these down votes  

now if im understanding correctly are you looking to print the age of every reservation for a given sport",1
  yes so if a user enters the char f for flying all the reservations that fall under that category within the sporttypeindex of char f would be printed out with their corresponding ages so if a patron age 18 who entered f was in the array it would print a patron aged 18 reserved a session of flying,1
  the main reason we would like all information pertinent to the question in the question is so that the question can stand the test of time if the information is stored at another site it can rothttpsenwikipediaorgwikilinkrot and this question will be rendered useless to people with the same or similar problems in the future a common second reason is we dont know what nasty things may be lurking at an off site link and may not be interested in finding out the hard way one evil flash banner can ruin your whole day,1
off topic editing the code i notice many functions claim to return a value eg int inputageint patronage int index but do not contain a return statement this will lead to no small amount of grief it is syntactically valid but is logically undefined and the compiler can do absolutely nothing or generate whatever code it wishes including seemingly correct code to do something your compiler should be warning you about this,1
thanks for the edits of the code      it sounds like what you want to do is search the array of sports for all indices that contain a particular value  in other words loop through sporttype and capture every index that leads to a certain character,1
  thanks for the heads up i will post the code directly in the future should i alter the functions to return instead of setting them equal in the inputnewreservation function my compiler didnt give me any warnings so i didnt realize this would impact my program operation,1
  so syntatically am i looking at something along the lines of a for loop that goes int i  0 i  size i  if sporttypeindex  insert char here print out message  with size being a counter variable that i set in main to increment each time a new reservation and thus an indices of the array is set,1
you have it recommend generalizing the function a bit and passing in insert char here and a string containing a longer description of the sport as parameters that way you only have to write one function for all sports,1
and dont forget to post the final code here so that others can find it in the future,1
compiler warnings sometimes need to be enabled in visual studio open the properties and navigate configuration properties ccgeneral and play with the warning level in gcc add a wall to the command line or play with the gui of whatever ide youre using to set the command line for you youll have to look that up yourself because there are dozens of them,1
and part three in inputreservation the line sporttypeindex  inputtypesporttype index counts on inputtype returning the correct value so currently the code blows itself up by not returning ideologically a function should do only one thing so input should just take input and hand that input off to someone who knows how best to store it the simpler a function is the easier it is to debug so char inputtypechar sporttype int index should probably be char inputtype read the user input into a temporary value test the value and return the value when its good,1
  i edited with my current revisions my program is currently running as far as letting the user enter the desired reservation type and patron age but is not printing anything when the user enters 2 i will revise again with the changes you suggested about changing the functions,1
the short answer is you have no print statement in the function that handles option 2 youll learn a lot more figuring out what the print statement has to look like than you will from being fed a canned answer so im going to walk away at this point,1
  alright well thanks for your help,1

then which time zone do you want to format in,1
neither timezone is unknown,1
then date isnt what you want as that represents an instant in time which only has a local yearmonthdayhourminutesecond when you apply a time zone the same instant has different values in different time zones and they dont make sense without a time zone its like asking for the binary encoding of a string without specifying an encoding,1
  no date represents measure of time it can mean one instant in one timezone and another instant in another,1
  no its like asking a distance without specifying an origin we have double type which holds this nobody requires to provide units of measurement and origin for doubles the same should be for datetime,1
  no it really doesnt date is an instant in time  a number of milliseconds since the unix epoch its not since some arbitrary point in time  it has a wellspecified origin the longer you fight against this the longer you will have problems please accept it if you dont believe me you should read the javautildate documentation which starts the class date represents a specific instant in time with millisecond precision,1
your code is correct you are also correct that it depends on your jvms time zone and for the same date object will produce differnt results in different time zones exactly therefore you need to specify for which time zone you want the result,1
if all you have is a point in absolute time relative to unix timestamp there is no way to format it without a time zone because that will display as a different time in different time zones  where and in what format does your value come from,1
  suppose it is in shire,1
  what are you saying does imply utc,1
  if you have a timezone you can specify that timezone and you wont have a problem,1
  i have no timezone i have hhmmss from third party source its timezone if unknown and may mean different instant than one i get if parse this string,1
  see my very simple example code showing that date is not instant,1
  it not only format matter you can also call gethours getter and see the same date is just not an instance if you use its components in any way and you use it in numerous cases for example if you read date from database server by clients all over the world you will get the same components but different gettime,1
iow you dont have an absolute time  you want httpsdocsoraclecomjavase8docsapijavatimelocaltimehtml,1
your tests dont show what you seem to think it shows youre parsing it in the system default time zone and constructing 19700101t000001 in the system default time zone however im done here youre ignoring both what the documentation says and what someone with considerably experience in datetime work says youre welcome to do that of course but youre not going to make any progress you should follow slaks advice and use localtime as thats what the value youre receiving represents it doesnt represent an unambiguous instant in time,1
  and you are ignoring how date is used in numerous libraries and tools i am done here too,1
  i dont want absolute time i want relative time,1
then you want localtime or localdatetime as thats precisely what they model,1
a date only contains an instant whether it contains a correct instance well if it contains an incorrect one it certainly wouldn’t be the first time in you socalled proof it contains an instant of 2 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds before the epoch — which in turn tells me you jvm’s time zone is at an offset of 3 hours from utc,1
dims i believe the real answer to your question is stay away from javautildate it confuses you and there’s no reason why you should want that use the newer classes in javatime instead like those   mentions,1
i dont want absolute time i want relative time i think what you are looking for is duration or period from javatime even so numerous libraries and tools use date doesnt mean its correct,1
 öhrl that depends on relative to what if relative to a time zone jon skeet’s suggestion is better if relative between two points in time you are entirely correct,1
 öhrl i agree it is not correct this is my point and it is not an instant but it is dual second nature of date appears not in formatting only but in many cases,1
 v absolutely just wanted to throw those into the field as they havent mentioned yet  dims this simply shows that time is a very complex field jon skeet is an expert there trust him,1
i agree in your view that the date class was designed with a “second nature” i just meant to say the state a date object holds is an instant only the second nature is in constructors the methods particularly the many deprecated methods but also in tostring this design is generally considered poor in retrospect and is one of the reasons new classes were designed twice first calendar and later all the javatime classes,1
  assume you have a date object created by expression new date601000 what is the expected string you want to generate from this,1
 v according to oop paradigm the internals of object is black box the true nature of object  is what you can get from it or set to it by its methods you cant say that some of methods are true and another methods are false the matter of fact is that date class has two contracts regardless the number of downvotes and regardless documentation there are a lot of libraries that read datetime and present it in date format for java in this moment the contract of number of milliseconds from unix era is violated,1
  in my situation i am receiving date time from another source and it is constructed from parts and i need to print exactly these parts your case is irrelevant,1
  if the date is constructed from say year month day in month hrs and min and you cannot guess the time zone used when constructing it there is no way you can fulfil the requirement of printing those parts from the date,1
  ok assume you have a date object created by expression new date70 0 1 0 1 0 what is the expected string you want to generate from this,1
  something like 19700101 000100 order should depend on format but components should be kept,1
 v please understand that timezone should not be part of date because date should measure time while timezone is a measure for space we are not storing kilograms meters and so on units in double and whe should not keep timezone in date,1
your update 4 only proves that gethours reflects the local time zone which you are changing  if one repeatedly evaluates ab and gets different sums when changing b that doesnt mean that a is also changing,1
  but this means that ab contains also b but not only a,1
contains is the wrong word but sure ab is dependent on both a and b in the same way that the hour returned from gethours is dependent on both the instant held by the date object and the local time zone  that does not mean that the instant changes when you change the time zone no more than it means that a changes when you change b,1
also you say in the sample hours property  however dategethours is a method not a property  java doesnt have properties in the same way that c has it only has methodshttpstackoverflowcoma2963249634824  a method that takes as input some outside information cannot be described as purehttpstackoverflowcoma22395430634824  therefore what you are observing is simply that the gethours method is impure because it takes the system time zone as one of its inputs,1
"  expression ab namely contains b you may say depends on but you cant say contains is wrong 

i never said instant changes i only said date contains not only instant and this is true date is the same as ab in your excellent example where a is an instant and b is timezone

in terms of java bean convention gethours is a property getter for property hours i may rewrite access to this property with any bean library the fact that getters in java do not have additional brace level changes nothing

of course you may say gethours is impure",1
i believe that it is finally clear what the problem is here if class a has a method getdata and this getdata method is returning a internal state which is an instant modified by some external value lets skip the timezone lets say its users screen resolution does this make a an instant or not and does this imply that a stores screen resolution or not  i believe that this is simply semantics thing  how you define what is an instant it seems that most people define instant differently from the questions author,1
  i understand instant as a point on time dimension i dont deny date contains instant i deny it is an instant we may say it is impure instant if you wish the very fact that date has so much depreated methods and that there are so many alternative implementations alone proves that javautildate is both impure and bad design,1
ok i understand what you mean  but can you refer to the example with screen resolution if the class with a private instant field would have a getdata method which would return value based on local screen resolution or any other environmental data would that mean that it is not instant just want to make sure that i get your instant definition right i believe that a game changer here would be to provide a definition of an instant from some trustful source because the discussion is about instants and nobody posted any definition yet,1
  it depends on whether it is possible to reach instant pure if the class would have only getdata which returns only instant dirtied with screen resolution i would say either it is not instant or some special sort of instant defined by class designer i am opened to any definition but it should not drift,1

trying to configure displaystartuperrors at runtime might not make the most sense though manual lists it as phpiniall changeable  but i think we are past the “startup sequence” at this point,1

  the sense is to make the application display errors if i check the development checkbox at login form if i dont check the session var will be null so errors display will be 0,1
what you want to achieve with this is clear but i doubt trying to set displaystartuperrors at this point makes any sense  we are probably a bit beyond the php “startup sequence” as the manual calls it as this point,1

start by learning to use vim without your mouse,1
force yourself not to use the mouse you will learn vims navigation shortcuts better that way also vim is designed to be inefficient youre supposed to glue together lots of strange tricks to navigate files this glueing of slow commands means vim is more configurable but harder to use than a modern editor,1
what do you mean am i using a i use i to go into insert how do i use vim without the mouse,1
well i starts the insertion before the cursor and a starts the insertion after the cursor this cheat sheethttpsvimrtorrcom might be handy,1

  i somewhat disagree vim is a tool used primarily for programming which disqualifies the offtopic close reason general usage,1

try httpsvimadventurescom   for learning vim  learn to not touch your mouse or any arrow keys,1
did you use vimtutor to start it sounds like you skipped that thirty minute intro,1
  vim is not designed to be inefficient the opposite is true its designed in a very different way then most editors to be more efficient,1
vim is a text editor not a code editor its designed to glue small commands together to do simple navigation like 10j wordcr tf etc which are composable for doing large repetitive tasks but intentionally inefficient for day to day navigating,1

printfthe sum of the numbers are d sum  printfthe sum of the numbers are d sum,1
why are you printing the variable address ,1
with d you should use the variable itself not the pointer in this way youre printing sums address,1
need to use n for cleaner output,1
alsothere is no need to do this in a loop sum of 1 to x is sum  x12,1
which compiler are you using gcc and clang both emit a warning format ‘d’ expects argument of type ‘int’ but argument 2 has type ‘int ’,1

you can use a debugger to find out whats going on,1
try put the cin instruction in the loop to let the user a chance to update the commandinput value on each loop,1
of course it runs infinitely the contents of the loop keep checking the same variables hoping that their values would somehow magically change on their own of course c doesnt work this way theres nothing inside the while loop that will change the values in the variables as such each iteration of the loop will always come up with the same results,1
have you tried stepping through the code using a debugger,1
commandinput  invreport this is not how you compare two strings,1

sounds like you have some nonvisible or hidden null bytes in your code similar to the behavior in this question python source code string cannot contain null byteshttpsstackoverflowcomquestions31233777pythonsourcecodestringcannotcontainnullbytes but of course on windows you might want to try copying the text from idle into another text editor that can view hiddennonascii encoding inspect for and remove any unusual characters then paste the cleaned text back into idle and try running the code again my guess something near that grey block between the print and x,1
also you could press edithttpsstackoverflowcomposts45065685edit on your question and copypaste the code into your question and let us view the text to check for hidden characters,1

dont know how on visual studio,1
as in maximum temperature,1
   dont know how on visual studio  so you didnt see debug in the main window of visual studio and wondered what it does  or hit f10 on a successful build of your program,1
  using a debugger is an essential skill for any programmer its very easy with visual studio a quick google search will give you tons of resources to guide you,1
  visual studio has integrated debugger search for online tutorials on how to use it,1
guys there is no error copy the code and use it to see my problemhttpsstackoverflowcomusers7359094franc3a7oisandrieux,1
google how to debug small programs read and implement,1
   you mean there are no compilation errors not runtime or logic errors  just because your program compiles without any syntax errors doesnt mean your program is free of bugs  also some advice  instead of 24 number try instead something much smaller like 5 numbers  that way it will be much easier for you to see where your program goes wrong,1
dude there is not a single error there is no errors i used the debugger and the compiler and there is no error,1
what else   ,1
  debugger doesnt show errors on its own you are supposed to step through your program while watching the values of the variables to figure out where the code functionality deviates from your expectations,1
if you had stepped through with your debugger and used a smaller easiertofollow top limit as suggested much earlier by   your would have spotted many errors,1
you have many many errors that you should have seen when running under your debugger,1
do note that void main is an error  main must return a int,1

edit your question and insert your code there its not readable in a comment,1
what do you mean by not working what tests did you run whats the output,1
javascript  java,1
whats your main method looks like add input and expected output,1
im going to guess in your main method you created a vendingmachine with 20 cans or 10 cans and add10 cans then inserttokenx2 theres your output,1
its because of machineadd10 either delete it or rewrite your expected count,1
why do you expect tokencount to be 0 in first place,1
"here is my teachers requirement for the codeprovide two constructors for the vendingmachine class
1 a default constructor vendingmachine that initializes the vending machine with
10 soda cans
2 a constructor vendingmachineint cans that initializes the vending machine
with the given number of cans
both constructors should initialize the token count to 0",1
it does what its supposed to do,1
im just trying to figure out what correction should i make in order to let the token count to be 0,1
in what scenario if youre trying to simulate a vending machine i guess each can should have a price and then when you insert tokens it accumulates them until it reached that price then youd zeroize the tokens number is that what youre trying to do,1
put pdbtrace before that line and try to print weight from that console,1
remove weight  global weight weight is already a global variable,1
  wait does weight  global weight not give you a syntax error it does for me both in py 2 and in py 3 so i dont think thats their real code,1
  it does there is more than one reason to remove that line,1
op please show us the real code the code that you included has a syntax error and there is no need to include those verbose user instructions,1
i removed the line you guys told me to but now it still tells me that weight isnt defined when i asked the user for it at the beginning of the program i really appreciate the help,1
i updated the original post with the code i currently have along with the functions,1
this programming language claims my is never a good start to a question never  99999999999999 of the time it is correct and it is very unlikely you found a bug in the language,1
please give us the exact error message full traceback not just python is telling me that weight isnt defined,1
please try to make a minimal code which actually shows the error ie i can run it and get the same error you are having it looks like you removed the part which is the actual cause of the problem but you dont know it for example an assignment to weight after the line with error and show the exact exception you are getting,1

lists arent considered string objects but   is so     is concatenating a string to the lists,1

please edit that into the question,1
what are these interspersed primaryg nsup and what are they supposed to tell us,1
and if that means primaryg is nsup… well then it is a string youre trying to concat with a list,1
those are just output from my print statements,1
"printprimaryp primaryp
    printprimaryg primaryg
    printprimaryain primaryain
    printprimaryaout primaryaout
    printprimarydin primarydin

it works if i only concatenate first two lists problem starts from third list onwards csrpgprimaryprimaryp  primaryg  works fine,1
at least one of the things you think is a list is not a list presumably everything that outputs as  instead of ,1
thats the bit im not able to understand i agree with you that first two elements im trying to addprimarypprimaryg dont look like list but more like strings however all six things im trying to add i declared them as lists and for firs two im just appending strings to them for eg primarypappendportname  where portname is a string now my understanding is even though portname is string now it has been added to a primarp list why it is giving an error when im trying to add primaryp to a bigger list csrpgprimary,1
hope i made the question clear code is so big that i dont want to post here and add confusion but my basic question is astringa a bxyzbiglist aappenda now if i do biglistab shouldnt that work,1
the problem is with 99999 certainty that somewhere in your “big code” you’re replacing the list with a string not appending to it,1

thats what ive said c is a superset of c that means a c code is also a c code but a c code is not always a c code,1
no c is not a strict superset of c just like the link i gave you says,1
thanks for the link i didnt know that not much of a c guy myself community driven qa mailing list etc brings out a primitive being wise syndrome i guess ,1
no c definitely wont always compile as c the first example i can think of is int foo  mallocsizeofint,1
no there are a nontrivial number of legal c programs that are not legal c programs anything involving vlas implicit conversions of void  to other pointer types any code that uses c keywords such as class or new as identifiers etc and that gap gets wider with each new language version  c and c are two completely different languages that share a large subset of syntax but then so do oberon and pascal,1

vbx you dont use any signalsslots connection am i missing something,1
  signals and slots are qt specific constructs what vbx gives you here is the standard c solution,1
  i see that but my question is qt specific i thought the notion of signal slot would be a good give away also if you would note i dont ask how to use try catch block,1
  your question is in no way qt specific qt is c it may have special macros and its own special little precompiler and build projects but its still c the fact that you happen to use signals changes nothing about exception handling,1
  the question is very qt specific count will be called asynchronously so knowning where the exception is handled is not as easy as it seems,1
  can you explain that a little generally parameters to a function are fully evaluated before the function is called how does the slot macro make it asynchronous,1
this is a string not a function call slotcount  1slot or maybe 2slot im not sure,1

so the  is the problem ,1
  exactly it seems you have colons in other ids also youve to remove all of them to get the page work,1
ok i will do that thanks so much for helping,1
haskells type classes are not a form of objectorientation they are a form of adhoc polymorphism which you typically also get from object systems but they do not couple data and methods which is the hallmark of objectorientation,1
  they do in fact couple data and methods  the type of the data determines which function or which part of the function definition if you want to view it that way is called,1
that couples the type of the data and methods httpwwwhaskellorghaskellwikioopvstypeclasses,1
  is right haskell typeclasses are much closer to oop interfaces than oop classes but even that analogy isnt perfect in fact the closest thing to oop classes in haskell are simply data types containing functions and monadic actionshttpwwwhaskellorghaskellwikifaqi27mmakinganrpgshouldidefineatypeforeachkindofmonster2candatypeclassforthem3f,1
  yes and that is characteristic of object oriented languages only a minority associate operations with instances at all in even fewer can that be described as the normal operation of the oo system,1
  i dont think this is true although it is an acceptable lie to children  if you dont think about the constraint system typeclasses are just a slightly restricted object system  in that typeclasses have 1 subtyping 2 implicit self reference 3 replaceable self reference aka inheritance  a typeclass is just a parameterized abstract class in oop while an instance is just an object that inherits from that abstract class  with ghc 74 and some trickery involving newtype unsafecoerce and implicit parameters this correspondence becomes complete,1
i also think that couple data and methods is really independent from oo  consider go as the example of a language where methods are separate from structs yet it is very oop,1
on the other hand the naive view that typeclasses are equivalent to interfaces and that datatypes in haskell are equivalent to classes in oop that implement those interfaces is just wrong  the typeclass system is a layer used for defining classes in the mathematical sense aka predicates over haskell types  it just happens to be an object oriented layer to for defining predicates over haskell types,1
  my answer in no way relies on oo being able to do everything that haskell type classes can do it relies on the haskell type class system being able to do everything that oo can,1
  dont know why im responding to this nonsense but typeclasses dont have subtyping dont have implicit self reference and dont have inheritance the haskells overlooked object system paper has a good discussion of why typeclasses dont do the job and hence what it proposes instead and i think the ohaskell paper also motivate the differences quite well anyway implicit parameters are not idiomatic haskell these days and unlikely to make it into a standard and once you start to involve unsafecoerce then youre clearly off the reservation,1
  im not sure what either of those papers have to do with my claim  the class per class encoding is clumsy i agree my point is more subtle  typeclasses in haskell are classes over types  we are all constructivist here so for us to suppose a type is a member of a typeclass requires some sort of evidence object  further the language provides an automatic theorem proving system in the form of inference and global instances  my claim is only that the proof language for this logic is oo and it is helpful for reasoning about haskell to be aware of this fact,1
the evidence type for membership in ord is a subtype of the evidence type for membership in eq  implicit this references and inheritance are what let you declare m  k  m    k in the definition of monad  to simulate this behavior with records requires finding a fixpoint as pointed out by oleg which should clue you in something is up  the reason this shouldnt be surprising is that typeclasses sit on the otherside of the expresion problem from abstract data types  from william cooks work we know that means they are probably objects,1
obviously this object system is a restricted one but you just need to look at bruno oliveiras work to know that is a nonessential aspect see scalas implicits  my point about unsafecoerce is that with some extensions and unsafe features you can actually get your hands on the objects that bare witness to typeclass membership   and using implicit parameters you can construct arbitrary such instances at runtime although it relies on the compiler not obeying its documentation,1
  the evidence type for membership in ord dictionary i suppose you mean isnt a subtype of the evidence type for membership in eq its just that ord membership implies eq membership an ord instance cant override eq methods i have no idea what youre getting at with the monad example  yes if you encode monads with objects then the encoding is objecty but thats because you chose an objecty encoding to begin with anyway this evidence type doesnt always exist other implementations of haskell such as jhc show you can go very far without a dictionary encoding,1
  a proof of membership in ord is a proof of membership in eq  is a is the same thing as subtype  the monad example is about inheritance not subtyping they are separate since unless a monad instance overrides the default definition of  it inherits a general one but this general one uses  which is defined virtually  this is what i was talking about in terms of implicit this parameter and inheritance   the point that you dont have direct access to this object system and that it isnt always implemented directly doesnt really matter  it explains the semantics,1
but you can explain the semantics without an object system too does the fact that i can explain counting with pebbles mean that naturals are a kind of collection of pebbles,1
  an object system is anything that meets certain criteria you cannot say the same of a collection of pebbles,1
that is a good point  i find that thinking about typeclasses as objects plus a prolog like theorem prover where every rule begins with a cute makes it easier to reason about something rather complicated and gives me access to a body of literatures and design principles that apply to my problem  thinking about c templates as a functional language sort of like haskell makes them easier to reason about also  i generally try to understand the weird edges of mathematical systems by describing them in terms of axioms i already know  you dont need ring theory to explain integers,1
i want to send the listint through tcp and ive already get the server and client connected now i need send the listint data from client to server i know the method send is based on char or char i dont know how to deal with listint thank you very much,1
you can turn the list of integers into a single string and parse it out on the other side,1
how many integers do you have it could be good enough to convert int to string snprintf fe and send each one with send,1
i have 25 different values i have to send the value one by one to the server which method should i use to convert it to string,1

wow really never thought about this,1
  you should change the title of your question to reflect your last comment whats the difference between pip and setuppy isnt much of a question it seems like youre actually interested in something a bit more specific,1
sure thanks a lot,1
  if you want the behaviour of pip use pip,1
thats somewhat misleading though  pip does use setuppy im sure if you get the right options or possibly use a wrapper script its possible to get the same results with setuppy,1
this is incorrect in most cases pip does download the package from pypi unzip it and run the setuppy script albeit with some extra options if you try to have pip install from a tarball for example without a setuppy youll get an error saying so,1
  sure but thats not the question  the question is why the one does not give identical results to the other,1
  obviously theyre not the same program they have different names but your answer fails to highlight the connection one calls the other or explain how to get setuppy to do what the op wants so its technically correct but not useful   has provided what the op was almost certainly looking for,1
  implying that theyre entirely separate when pip calls setuppy is misleading,1
  not really pip probably also uses list but it doesnt follow that they are connected the question does not ask how can i reimplement pip myself,1
  in the context of installing a package pip and setuppy are clearly connected,1
  they may be connected but the question doesnt ask are they connected  it asks why they dont have the exact same behaviour and the answer is because they are not supposed to thats all there is to it how they achieve those effects is not relevant,1
  what other answer is there there is no reason whatsoever to expect them to have the same behaviour you might as well complain that i havent dumped the whole code for pip in my answer,1
  of course you can expect them to have similar behaviour they both serve to install a python package its different behaviour that needs explanation as for another answer  s answer is a good start  providing a single option to setuppy makes it behave like pip thats relevant and likely useful,1
  why does different behaviour need explanation pip does not advertise that it provides identical behaviour nor vice versa in so far as they are supposed to be similar they are similar they install a python package to expect a different explanation is like asking why you and i dont use the same writing style neither of us has indicated that we would,1
  different behaviour requires explanation because the question is about the difference in behaviour where would humanity be if we never asked how or why,1
  almost all code questions could be answered by reading enough source but asking can give more useful information more quickly re different things see redblue example above,1
  the reason why you dont perceive blue and red as exactly the same thing is because they are not exactly the same thing there is no deeper explanation than that if you want to inquire into the mechanisms of perception that is a different question,1
  in both the ops question and my redblue example saying because theyre different does not convey any information that the asker did not already know assuming the question is posed in order to gain information an answer that does not provide information has no value a useful answer to the ops question might discuss how the difference is implemented or why developers chose different mechanisms for the redblue conundrum a useful answer might cover wavelengths of light pigments and colour receptors in the eye,1
  the details of the way that the programmeeye works can be informative and interesting given that the question is asked to gain information if the literal answer to the question contains no information we can infer that we have misunderstood what the asker wants in that case we can attempt to infer the question they meant to ask and provide useful information this process does not always work perfectly but its better than an answer with no information,1
  you may doubt your powers of comprehension but i am confident in my own when someone asks a nonsensical question i assume they dont know that what they are asking is nonsensical rather than inferring that it is an oblique way of soliciting a general disquisition on the topics mentioned in that case informing them that their question is nonsensical is new information,1
  no the question can be clearly understood to have a rational answer more specific than a general discussion possible readings are how can i make them behave in the same way which vartec answered how do they achieve different results similar or why did the developers choose different mechanisms we can presume the pip developers were aware of the other mechanism,1
  leave the votes of others out of it  you are still arguing that i should make up a new question if you want this to be a different question go ahead and edit it,1
  the votes of others became relevant when the discussion moved to what so is about in as much as so is a community what it is about is determined by the opinions of its members,1
  well if you really want to argue about that it turns out that so users dont have to leave a reasoned explanation for their downvotes for example i am getting a bunch of downvotes on old questions which i assume come from you for obvious reasons and vartec whenever he sees my handle he is reminded that i once pointed out an error in one of his answers so no they dont really convey much information,1
  i have not gone back to downvote your other answers and i do not intend to,1
  perhaps vartec is feeling extra insecure today,1
  no its not an ad hominem look it up otoh your comment is a childish attempt to provide an excuse to withdraw from the discussion,1
i will downvote any answer that is clearly wrong   if you can name any of your correct answers that ive allegedly downvoted dont be shy mention it,1
  you know that i cant tell who is downvoting my answers especially as you never leave comments one presumes that is because you have no valid criticisms,1
  he means his great answers like httpstackoverflowcomquestions10129080analysisanddesignforfunctionalprogramming1012917210129172,1
  i note that you havent left a comment on that i defy you to locate any inaccuracies in that answer,1
im not going to try to arbitrate on other answers withdrawing from the discussion on the other hand sounds like an excellent idea   good luck trying to argue the case for this answer,1
  theres no case to be argued you have spent several hours complaining that i have provided an answer to the question asked not to your preferred question you could complain about every other question on so on that basis,1
  any fyi your revenge downvotes will get revoked,1
  just because you string some words together it doesnt follow that they make sense youre the one whose fragile ego has lead you to engage in a campaign of downvoting my answers willynilly,1
  unlikely its good to know that you dont understand the downvotereversing system,1
i really appreciate your work and comments on this thread actually those comments run beyond my expectation i might need to recheck my question statements for clarity or i should fire another question then,1
how do i do that in c,1
this is the formula for the euclidian distance it doesnt apply to the earth since its not a linear the latlong space is not a plane,1
you dont have xyz you have latitude and longitude a coordinate system where one of the coordinates is not parallel on a spherical surphace to boot neither of your formulas works,1
   i know how to do all of them didnt quite understand it being in that form,1
  first the earth is kind of spherical second the parallels are curved on the spherical surface because they are not the shortest line between two points the definition of straight the meridians are a useful formula has to take this into account the first formula above can be a useful approximation when the distance isnt too big,1
it would be nice to have a library that can just even suggest for the review,1
what does this answer mean of course it is possible to check the text of python code for duplication just like any other language,1
  i know that you can check it however the op is asking for a library to check it for him atleast thats what i think hes trying to ask,1
  there is no reason why you couldnt create such a tool for python they exist for other languages,1
i believe the answer means youd have to roll your own duplicate code checker solution someone else probably hasnt done that yet,1
  i know you can make your own but op is asking if there is one already made,1
  your answer strongly suggests that it is impossible there is no way to really distinguish whether it has repeated or not,1
  ok i will edit it now ,1

  well unfortunately i have way too much experience in both php and answering questions so it leave no place for doubts ,1
  thats known problem with this site most answers just triggered by the keywords in the question or even just question title people seldom trying to get the meaning of the question but rather tend to directly answer to some keywords it is fastest gun in the west problem partially to blame for this and whole stackoverflow paradigm which encourage votes not real help,1
how would the compiler know if a public field of a public class is used it could be used in an assembly thats not a part of the current build,1
seconding that i do not believe the issue is what you describe inlines the values the compiler would only do that for const  otherwise ldfld is used and the jit is not going to worry overly about is this assigned elsewhere the only things that might affect this are obfuscators and full linkers like aot in mono incidentally properties would be far preferable to fields here imo,1
also methodimplmethodimploptionsnoinlining is not valid on fields so i doubt that is your real code,1
i have added more behavior comment in the code sample i dont know why or how the compilerjitter makes assumptions all i see is what the debugger shows me and that is no matter if the value is true or false it will simply not perform the true part of the if no matter value in optssilent if optimizations are enabled but will behave correctly if i disable them,1
  you are correct the statement does not work or even compile for that matter i had pasted in there to mention that i have tried this avenue without success but i forgot to remove it when i pasted the code here ill remove it,1
please post optsparse,1
what the hell is volatile doing there like eric lippert said if you are using volatile you are probably using it wrong,1
well i could post parse and all methods that go with it but that would be rather voluminous and it is not the problem parse works fine the values a read fine the debugger sees the good values its just that although after parsing optssilent is trueconfirmed by debugger and watch the code behave as if it is still false and the same goes for the other variables well this is no longer the behavior since i mark them as volatile but it is when i remove it everything would be fine if it would also be allowed on doubles,1
  volatile instructs the compiler to make no assumptions on the content of the variable as it might be changed by another thread at anytime thus disabling some optimizations on it,1
  and there is your mistake i bet you only have a single thread running making this assumption pointless  unless for some absurd reason you have parse running as a thread,1
  everything would be fine wait your claim is that this doesnt work even for the bool one no your sample is for the bool one so what is failing the bool or the double,1
but to emphasise i dont know why or how the compilerjitter makes assumptions  simple it doesnt,1
im pretty sure that volatile didnt fix your problem but just masked it you clearly do something horribly wrong in optsparse but without the relevant code we cant tell you what,1

what is the difference between powered on and rebooted,1
it starts at zero at a full boot not at a restore from sleep or hibernation  not caring about this is important not in the least because this behavior isnt promised anywhere,1
  if you dont want to answer then dont obviously theres a difference in my case,1
gettickcount can roll over dont use it for longrunning events and being rude to people trying to help you guarantees no one will answer your question,1
i think sarnold was asking for a reasonable clarification not least because a reboot does powercycle the machine making it unclear what you might have expected the difference to be,1
   sarnolds question is extremely pertinent the fact that you dont recognize it as such does not warrant rudeness especially if you expect anyone to help you after observing your attitude ill rephrase his question for you what is your perceived difference between powered on and rebooted,1
  passant so youre saying its a reboot right not a shutdown,1
thats a nonsensical distinction whats the difference between a shutdown followed by a poweron vs a reboot,1
  its important here not to be rude to people youre asking for free help  asking for more information or clarification isnt not wanting to answer please try and be polite and there is absolutely no difference between a shutdown and a reboot a reboot is a shutdown with a restart to the os the difference is only meaningful to the bios and hardware,1
the problem is that nobody has yet figured out what the value is while the machine is shut down,1
you dont power on an os  you power on a physical piece of hardware  anyway it should be pretty trivial to test whether gettickcount returns a value indicating when windows was started and when the hardware was powered on,1
the difference between a machine having been shutdown vs rebooted is that a shutdown can be followed by a poweroff when reboot does not still why does it matter what i need this for obviously i do otherwise id not ask it here is it also worth going into all this polemic vs simply answering the question and to sarnolds question  my answer was to the way he worded it when i read it,1
a shutdown can be followed by a poweroff huh how can a shutdown not be followed by a poweroff when reboot does not according to whom still why does it matter what i need this for it doesnt  nobody asked that to begin with is it also worth going into all this polemic vs simply answering the question yes because your question is nonsensical and we need to make sense of it in order to answer it come back when you learn how to ask a proper question or at least learn how to not be rude to people trying to help you,1
  what is not clear in my question you reboot computer and it simply reloads os  the power is not turned off when someone shuts it down the power can be switched off or computer can be powered off i want to know if rebooting a computer resets the tick counter how else do you want me to word it to skip all this bs,1
you reboot computer and it simply reloads os  the power is not turned off according to whom why do you think this were back to your perceptions here which you have yet to adequately explain,1
i hope my edit clarifies things,1
   until someone describes the perceived difference to the os between rebooting and restarting and shutting down then powering on i doubt it,1
httpenwikipediaorgwikirebootingcomputingsoftreboot,1
and btw i am pretty sure this can be empirically tested,1
   again regarding soft reboots what is the difference to the os which is whats being queried here,1
  based on the answer below nothing,1
   exactly my point ,1

  i will do that jspref  although the question is important i have to convert my script to object literal notation anyway  when that is eventually done ill put it on the site and place a link here,1
" t i only half answered your request for clarification   
proper objects  objects created using object literal notation  all use of the word object refers to that as opposed to a regular object under javascript",1
  i have no idea why you have this requirement there is no distinction between objects initialised with object literal notation and objects built up in some other fashion beyond syntax at the point of initialisation absolutely none at all its like asking how to convert a car to a proper car where proper car means the car was built in japan rather than korea its meaningless,1
 t the requirement is mainly educational  i guess it boils down to this  i currently am not wrapping my functions within objects but that would change if i use that style  if i understand your answer object literal notation is an issue of style and will have the exact same performance as other javascript objects that contain functions  i should research performance issues in javascript relating to dereferencing where objects are concerned  i think,1
  yes more or less whether you created an object with object literal notation or not has no bearing whatsoever on the object itself  its just an initialisation syntax,1

adding a reference to a dll in another projects bin directory is typically a very bad thing especially if the projects are in the same solution and you have a build server set up it will cause headaches,1

php sessions are not stored in ram but as files on the disk and who told you they are lost when the webserver is restarted,1
   i didnt realize php sessions were stored on disk that said my point on durability stands if the server crashes as opposed to restarts you lose your session data with redis or mysql backed sessions you have better durability,1
even then you dont necessarily lose them unless the os crashes and the session file is damaged or wasnt actually written to the harddisk yet,1
i would also think that if redis is installed on the same machine as phpthe webserver then it would not count as reading over the network,1
given that php native sessions are stored on disk the point of security is no longer valid,1

quoting the exact number does actually help its the string of digits for the project euler 8 problem   you could use a bignum library but in this case you can solve the problem easily by leaving it as a single character string and just looking at 5characterlong substrings,1

please post the code it seems you are using the pointers in a wrong way in your code,1
float and float is a different type,1
from all error messages i think its pretty obvious that he is trying to use a pointer to float as a float or not,1
its great that you posted the error messages unfortunately theyre not of much use without the code,1
you should usually post the code but i can assume from the error messages that in lines 28 and 39 you compare between a float which is either a pointer to a float but in this case you mentioned arrays and a float which is probably a regular variable or a spot in your array just make sure that if its an array you use in lines 28 and 39 you should always use square brackets and when its lines 29 and 63 the problem is probably assigning a float variable the value of a pointer which is probably your array again make sure to use square brackets to mention where in that array,1

coming from metathis question is actually not the worst quality wise you explained what you did and what the problem is however i think you have been downvoted because its almost impossible for someone to help you without seeing your code and your environment as indicated by the answers all anyone can do is tell you how to debug yourself so is better suited to questions which can be definitively answered if you find the solution to your problem your answer could help to make this question more useful for the community though ,1

the printfs are incorrect there behaviour is undefined there is no parameters given for the printfts d,1
guys if u dont know the solution of this problem  then leave the thread dont try to ruin the discussion,1
it looks pretty basic to me your code is totally broken so it can produce any output because it has undefined behaviour look up the printf documentation,1

the remove method of an event should not remove all handlers but rather the handler that was requested to be removed,1
if hes only added one then if he only removes one in effect hes removed them all  im not saying use it in all cases just for this specific resharper message,1
but you dont know that the delegate is always removing the only item on the invocation list  this is making the resharper message go away by turning correct working code into incorrect broken code that will in certain circumstances coincidentally work but that will break in unusual and hard to diagnose ways in many cases,1

your method returns error using bridging headers with framework targets is unsupported,1
  you cant use a bridging header in a framework target as the error suggests  the only option is to put it in the main framework header file unfortunately,1
if you had actually red the title of this thread you would have seen that the guy is wanting to import the commoncrypto library into a swift framework you cannot use bridging headers in frameworks and you cannot import the commoncrypto framework into the umbrella header,1

var item  thisisnotanarray,1
thats a bad solution a string has also a length,1
actually a string is an array of characters so in essence this does work,1
   string is a primitive typehttpsdevelopermozillaorgenusdocsglossarystring in javascript whereas array is an object in common language youre correct  a string is an array of characters  but in javascript this assertion is wrong its an important distinction and the reason why this is a bad answer,1
no a zerolength array is still an array,1
you can put typeof item  object and the answer can be acceptable,1

why is the array 2dimensional,1
you guys think i dont have my book doesnt cover it neither does my teacher its not like i dont want  to learn it  i just asked to create a static method i dont like coming on here because people are rude and assume the worse this was my last resort hence why i posted ive gone on google  i know how to search im a big boy thank you very much lastly my book absolute java only covers static method quickly and gives double value if i take any 2d array i should not be able to mix it with doubles if the array are objects you guys dont need to assume your goal should be,1
my question was just towards 2d arrays and using them with a double values like i was asked i know how to code a method i just didnt know where to start which was my question i dont want anyone to code it for me you guys dont need to downvote to oblivion the goal of this website is for people to learn not to be spoon fed and you guys steer newbies away from learning  most of you,1

please provide that to your question ,1
this code only i have used to trying to set the stream content,1
you can try use data  filegetcontentslogopng instead using file and img in fopen to get the image content,1
if i use like this mean where i want to specifies the read mode for logopng file,1
please check my answer i dont try it first but i hope itll run well you can try it ,1

how does it work and what did you expect instead btw this became an audit and is now featured on meta httpmetastackoverflowcomquestions291502isthisanothergoodreviewauditquestion,1
is it absolutely necessary to change the tags can you use an img and div and show and hide them respectively,1
you need to show more examples,1
you could start by reviewing the spec for nsstring,1
do not use center its been deprecated,1
since html4 ad 1997,1
your code doesnt compile at all formatstring is being called incorrectly what output are you expecting 1 until this information is provided so shouldnt be expected to get your code to compile by the way,1
cant you do this with just printf by itself,1
calc1hours  calc2hours is an expression returning a value but you havent assigned the return value to anything so it is lost neither of the operands are actually changed,1
  dont take it personal everything on so is about the content of a question or answer not a person the comment above is just a result of my vote to close on this particular question,1
time1 and calc1 are not related in any way,1
the code would not compile with an abitrary good compiler and wall because the returnstatement is missing,1
evaluating a subtraction eg 10  7 doesnt turn 10 into 3  the value of the subtraction is 3 and you need to store that someplace else eg calc1hours  calc1hours  calc2hours but this can be abbreviated as calc1hours  calc2hours as noted in the answers,1
your while loop isnt doing anything because n is not 0 but 10 try with n  0  as long as n is not 0 loop,1
yeah got it now it works thanks ,1
you are saying while n is 0 do this n is initially 10 so the loop is never executed,1
just fyi if youre stuck and not going into debugging just put a few print statments around and youll see that n is 10 so the while loop will never run just a handy way to see things sometimes systemoutprintlnn before the loop  then print something the while loop youll never see this then after the while loop should give you an idea whats running not running,1

what do you mean by the extension name appears in the file name  where does it appear  if you were creating a file exampletxt but the txt is showing up in a windows explorer window and you werent expecting it to the problem is with your windows settings not with the java program,1
sorry this is windows filenames question not java,1
ehh this is completly diffrent question now ,1
you mean the solution provided by   is irrelevant,1
i think you need to delete this question and ask a new one probably with a windowsexplorer tag  if you create a file whose name ends in txt it will have a txt extension  if you want a file with a txt extension but you dont want to see the txt in a list of files then its a windows explorer question  it has nothing to do with your program or with any programming language,1
i think he will still be able to open it with notepad  only he needs to choose the program to open with manually,1
are all the other text files on your computer also shown as example2txt and this file shows as exampletxt but not exampletxttxt or anything stupid like that,1
i think   is right this is the problem with windowsexplorer,1
  problem is possibly a bit harsh personally i hate it when an operating system has been set up so the file extention isnt shown,1
whats the question,1
yes i cant think of a solution for this it was asked in an online round can anyone help me with the algorithm,1
  yes once i get a logic for the solution i would definitely post it on my blog   and as you said stack overflow is for questions,1
the output is a little confusing the input numbers are not distinct but youre asked to print at least one of them how will you know which one the output refers to,1
  i dont have the exact question i wrote the question as much as i remembered could you help me getting the minimum of such bombs leave printing the index,1
can you give an example of two snippets whose compared performance youre interested in,1
"sadly i cant  its confidential work for my independent study im an undergrad  but i can say that the original code can run 10000 main loops with an initial energy of 100 or 100000 and will take 5 minutes and 24 hours respectively so ive been trying to optimize it as best as i can

edit  original code was written 10 years ago too",1
is said to be slower please give evidence for this statement who said that was it supported by data 10 years ago most compilers had difficulty to achieve the same level of optimisation but today there are absolutely not differences in performance afaik,1
you dont have to put your actual code few people do we all have privacycontractual concerns but you always can post representative snippets of code so that we can better help you otherwise we are all guessing,1
of course depending from what you do in those cycles anything can happen but they  sound a bit too slow to me did you enable the optimizations of your compiler what compiler are you using,1
  when you profiled the original code how much time did you determine was spent accessing data compared to doing all the other math etc that your simulation is doing where was your actual bottleneck what about in your new code also it may be worth noting that theres zero difference between a c array and a c array,1
sorry for the late response also the original code isnt mine and is well over 5 thousand lines of code in fortran a language im not too confident in  in terms of bottlenecking im still unsure as to where that may be though i think having reread through the code it might be due to the original one writing to files in each loop instead of batch writing every say 50 loops,1
why 50 millions of tables not 50 millions of servers,1
now seriously what original issue youre trying to solve how are we supposed to tell if its good or bad if we dont know what is being solved,1
i am not sure i understand this but i have one server and one database,1
i am storing tons of images the images are stored as files in the database i am putting the info about the images location time username,1
what exactly is wrong with just one table and 50 million records,1
so why not one db one table 50million rows,1
in my case is it better to have 50m tables or 50m rows,1
  how would you select from them in that case and why did you even start thinking about having 50m of tables,1
based on the 20 character unique image id,1
ok its 20 character id so what is there a rule as soon as you have 20 character id  create a table per row,1
seems like i am being squeezed in the corner the question is simple is 50m tables bad if yes how to deal with this,1
  50m tables is terrible how to deal with this  as you would deal if you had 42 rows or 42k rows  with a single table and multiple rows,1
  yes exactly,1
is there any limit to the number of rows,1
is there a point where i should split the tables eg how many rows with a primary key is it a good idea to have,1
  why,1
mysql can handle millions and millions of records before it needs partitioning,1
something else in my design i have 3 rows per table how can i move this to one table,1
i may get fired but at least i have a metagross level 100,1
you are very correct but this brings a bigger question should one study and learn or learn by trial and error to be honest i am amazed this isnt locked,1

so what happens when you analyze tempx and tempy string contents just prior to calling add on them what do they hold do they have extra spaces,1
if you still want an answer youll need to find out what strings are failing to parse and post them here print them to the console with characters surrounding them like systemoutprintln  x   in case there is trailing whitespace also do not swallow that exception in nextactionperformed at least print its stack trace so you find out if an exception is being thrown,1
works fine unless the references to it are taken from the array  does that mean that your posted code string tempx  aracc2 string tempy  aracc3 string outs  addtempx tempy works but the ui freezes if you change it to string outs  addaracc2 aracc3,1

changing the compile version and the target is not a solution just a workaround that will prevent you from using new apis,1
functions are depreciated as typically a newer more improved alternative has been included its counter productive and just incorrect to use this method id recommend either content values as mennaallah sami has provided or mapstring string,1

while this may incur a small penalty it can be done once before comparing the pattern to any input string so the timecomplexity is o1 not on where n is the length of the input string in short the impact is minimal at best,1
 and what precisely is the error,1
you should use braces around your if and for statements to avoid ambiguity also remove punct makes no sense,1
as you could see the question doesnt require you to store the result you traverse every character one by one why not just write the each character one after another if it is not a punctuation,1
error cannot bind stdistream aka stdbasicistreamchar lvalue to stdbasicistreamchar,1
 çkinsavaşçı can you please give the solution ,1
you arent going to learn anything if someone just hands you the solution youll probably want to use stdgetline instead of streaming in data via operator,1
  i am programming in c11  so i dont think there is a need to use stdgetline,1
i dont think  famous last words,1
if someone asked you to write a word processorwould you think a traditional compiler would be able to understand a program like while user makes input  process the words   perhaps the likes of google and siri have given you the impression that you can just write remove punct or remove punct if it is either a period or a comma  but putting parentheses after an if doesnt magically allow you to write anything you want as a condition nor does putting a semicolon at the end of a line of text make it code  the language has rules  the book is for learning them,1
and the problem is,1
what is the question,1
your conditions are not sufficient,1
so n1 can never be biggest,1
you never assign a value to biggest basically this overwrites a piece of your input any time a test passes,1
among other things you should be assigning a value to biggest eg biggest  n2 rather than n2  biggest,1
  the problem is that it returns 0 instead of returning the biggest number,1
i know but how could i be while there are these kind of people who did not reading question and wrote commentsi am sorry but people should be more careful while they are reading the question the should read well,1
  youve already had an answer to that you never assigned a value to biggest thats trivial the rest of your program is wrong and you have several suggestions that answer that but youve downvoted all of them,1
the inaccurate comment cout does not return 0 it may output 0 or who knows what or nothing at all at the end of your code does not constitute a question try something like why does this output 0 instead of the biggest number,1
there your question now has a question youre welcome,1
i dont understand what you mean by a full pyramid can you post an example of the desired output,1
  edited the post to the output that i want is there any way to post the picture of the output that i wantthank you,1
  i want to print again the same output but with spacelike one triangle from the left with this numbers and one from the right just like the output,1
you cant its a one way function not intended to be reversible,1
well md5 is more or less considered broken by now its likely that we will see significant advances in breaking md5 in the next couple of years so if you can wait 10 years then it should be possible with a combination of advances in cryptanalysis and computing power to do this in a practical timeframe even without the use of rainbow tables,1
you didnt supply any password when encrypting it so it wouldnt be a useful form of encryption even if it were encryption since anyone could run the decryption function,1
 örg no the hash does not contain enough information about the original string it isnt a matter of complexity,1
why do you think there is some error looks good to me,1
am i doing something wrong  at a guess youve assumed that the arguments to point are latitude followed by longitude rather than longitude followed by latitude,1
"when displaying geopointstastext lat and long should be other way 

i have double check returned values for stastext for both a geography point and a geometry point 

for a geometry point the returned values are correct as per stx and sty property extensions 

for geography points stastext returns the wrong values for point it should be point lat long

this is a bug which i will report it",1
its not a bug its point long lat as should be obvious when you can find plenty of examples when the first parameter is greater than 90,1
"it is definitely a bug check out the stastext for a geography column 
truncating a value is one thing completely swapping the values is a bug which is the case here definitely a bug",1
okay well try saying it another way look at the example in stpointfromtexthttpmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarybb933979aspx set    geographystpointfromtextpoint12234900 4765100 4326 if you can provide me a link to a map showing the location on earth of that point at a latitude of 122 as you claim then you might have a point,1
andrew please check wickedfans correctly referenced linked from msdn points are represented as pointlatlongsrid consider a case where data needs to be converted from geography to geometry there are several ways of doing this one of which is to use stastext which produces the text pointlatlong etc this will not work as the geography version creates the wrong text but the geometry insertion expected pointxy etc this method also allows for change of projection,1
damientheunbeliever please check the example i gave and my reply to andrew wickedfan also correctly provided the reference to msdn documentation of the definition of point in this case i am trying to convert large amount of data from geography to geometry and change the projection at the same time hence the reason for using staastext and not the binary version staastext for geography should return the value of point as per definition on msdn,1
damientheunbeliever put any value you like below 90 for geography version the staastext function still returns swaps the values around,1
   ive pointed you at an example where a geography is constructed from a wellknown text using a first parameter of 12234900 where on the globe do you think that this point is located the convention in wkt is long lat not lat long this is different from the convention you may have expected but its not a bug what it may indicate is that because you assumed it was lat long youve entered your data incorrectly,1
final note if you think this is a bug then submit a bug report to microsoft instead of discussing it here we cant help you to fix this bug we are not microsoft you can disagree with me but my point stands as others seem to agree with my answer,1
"   without a doubt this is a bug i dont live or die by stackoverflow equally i dont make comments publicly without thoroughly testing it i needed to ensure this is a bug  as it may have an impact on other peoples projects equallyhence my attempted consultation on stackoverflow it is important that people on this forum equally act responsibly as their comments and marking has an impact on other peoples projects

standard c has no parsers,1
what does your documentation for  say does it say that it supports arbitrary boolean expressions mine doesnt,1
  im unclear what you want here are you expecting tobool to take in a string and evaluate it as a logical expression,1
yes im not sure if im doing this right but this function handles with simple requests like true  false etc,1
 is not a boolean expression parser it is simply being used to convert true or false and nothing else,1
what error you getting,1
as error says so any of your select query return more than one value thats why you got error debug that using print after each select query so that you can find where exactly error is  or create sqlfiddle,1
one of your select stament returning more than one value instead of returning single value try running each select statement individually for that particular id,1
some of your sub queries returning more than on value execute sub queries separately and verify,1
seems you are here just to troll instead of helping  ,1
you really need to take a typing or keyboarding class so you dont need things like define pb pushback  this kind of abbreviations make your program less readable and more difficult to code inspect,1
you are crossing the streams by using stdin and cin  reference movie ghostbusters  decide either c streams or c style io printf or cout fscanfstdin or cin,1
invest in spaces around operators as it makes code easier to read  the spaces are free dont add any time to compilation build or execution  the spaces dont add any more size to the executable  an easy to read program will contain less defects  unless your keyboard isnt working correctly,1

i was specific i want the menu to look like that in the link and i copied over the html and css after pressing f12 but it doesnt display the same whats so not specific about that,1
youre supposed to show that youve put some effort into this yourself instead of asking for how to execute your idea try it yourself look at the source for that page and see if you figure it out if you run into barriers while you try to find your solution then post your questions in a thorough and detailed way thats likely why it was down voted,1
ok where is your try,1
your result array must be shorter than source in java it is impossible to change array length,1
i was looking specifically for the logic ie what could be the approach to the problem like say for the word apple if i shift the index to the left once i found any repeated character and it would be like aplee after the final iteration  now how to removedrop the last index of the array so as to make it aple,1
there are lots of ways to solve this  i expect your interviewer was more interested in how you approached the problem than in the specific solution  also  he  she would want to know if you have a clear understanding of how java arrays work eg that you cant make an existing array shorter or longer,1
this is cstyle cast,1

for example i need to cat etcshadow which permission shows as  1 root root i have no right to change it by using chmod and when i use other user to running phpfpm when a php script do systemcat etcshadow it return permission denied,1
you could create a group shadowreaders and put the phpfpm user into that group then sudo chown rootshadowreaders etcshadow and sudo chmod gr etcshadow,1
i have no right to do any operating to the file such as chmod,1
then you will never have a chance to run anything as root,1
ok thank you so as you say the only way is to compile a new phpfpm,1
no im clearly saying dont run phpfpm as root,1
this is not a valid answer to the question there are times where phpfpm should be given root privileges for example i have a singleuser linux vm set up behind nat all port forwarding is only done from my loopback adapter this vm shares dirs with the win32 vm host and the utility which shares the resource requires all files to be owned by rootroot on the linux guest os only solution is for php5fpm to also run as root in order to be able to readwrite to filesdirectories in the shared location this is a perfectly fine usecase for running php5fpm as root,1
same as i did chown r rootroot   now vim can only run as root,1
  sometimes the best answer to how do i x is very much dont ever do x  consider things like writing an accounting package in bcpl or an operating system in cobol or pretty much anything in perl pax ducks for cover running vast complicated processes as root is an incredibly bad idea if the process needs some superpowers give it execute access to a very tightly controlled executable that can do it instead and thats all it can do locking down a small tightly controlled executable is far easier than locking down a vast behemoth,1
re dont ever do x i believe that this is sometimes valid but in this context where the utility in question provides a command line flag called allowtorunasroot the highest voted answer is correct and should be accepted,1
  why do you need it to run as root note that even apachenginx are not running as root i dont see a reason why a development server by selfdescription should run as root and it never needs to  do if you have a proper development environment thats what my answer is saying,1
  my particular use case is a docker container where phpfpm needs to write to a mounted directory  there are probably others  again if the utility exposes a method of doing so easily why shouldnt that be the accepted answer,1
  i would like to give an advice in your particular use but i wont here in comments because i simply dont know enough about it and i dont say it is always a simple solution i can only clearly say that youll never release a software in a halfway organized company that requires a web server to run as root thats for sure i mean your use case sounds like you are about to not only do this in development where php s is meant for but also in production i encourage you to ask a question on serverfault or superuser,1
  another thing while i would have not implemented the dont run as root restriction at all there must be a reason why php developers decided so i would simply leave it up to the user to do that or not or better saying shoot in his own feet or not i mean you can run apache as root if you want for example however i cant say why they then added the r option that makes no sense imo i only say dont run a web server as root,1
let us continue this discussion in chathttpchatstackoverflowcomrooms113450discussionbetweenhek2mglandthreeve,1

this is a misleading answer please select the colinhoemigs answer as its much more helpful,1

i would suggest removing this as the correct answer primarily because it is wrong i personally find maxwell collards answer to be the best,1
yeah and i even tried fixing it but the hate is real also the initial down vote was for this is completely wrong unless randomnumber is gaussiannormal to start with but i had in mind the exact situation where unless randomnumber is gaussiannormal to start with,1

this isnt angular,1
im sure its and there should be a way but in certain applications online banking for example you cant just display the visual interface of an online banking account even when theres no values or no information,1
2 years ago and i do still think the same way after having done a few angular applications without any problem and i usually change my mind in this case i didnt i still believe that in some cases showing even the plain useless html code of your interface is a risk and you clearly dont work in security,1
give me the reason and the solution to solve this problem,1
  you cannot use the variable symbol name twice in the same scope,1
if copy the string in the other string variable and the try to create the objectthen also it gives error string s1 the strcpys1name then test s1,1
  u can also face the same problem if u go and work with real time problems,1
you cant specify a variable name at runtime variable names exist only at compile time perhaps you could describe why you want to give it a runtime name so we could suggest an alternative solution,1
you cannot achieve this using c variable names only exist up to the point of compilation and what you want to do is assign a variable a name at runtime which is clearly after the compilation,1
i have a feeling you want some mapping from entered strings to objects like a stdunorderedmap such that you can enter the same string later and access that object because the string is the key,1
  seymour i got this problem in a coding event,1
its evil  hint  if your string doesnt contain any u youll get a segfault otherwise it will simply count the number of characters preceding the first u of the given string,1
how about running it and see if you wanted you could even ptrint out the result of 1  funstring  1,1
itll be better question if you explain more about what youve tried and why you think like that,1
it reckon the successive u from the beginning,1
run in a debugger and step through the code line by line entering the recursive call if it comes that far,1
also theres no such languages as cc c and c are two very different languages even if parts of their syntax is similar,1
  if the string doesnt contain any u it returns 0 the function simply counts number of u in a row from the beginning of the string why do you think it makes a segfault i cant understand,1
  suppose the string is dynamically allocated and is 6 bytelong its content is hello0 after having checked the last character string5 0 which is  u we will call the function again and dereference string6 which is not allocated ,1
  if the string content is hello0 then the first line of the function will return 0 and stop recursing when it encounters h as the first character h  u,1
oh yes my bad  didnt read carefully enough still if the string is full of u and not null terminated the risk remains although much more unlikely,1
ive one idea write some code,1
what are you trying to achieve,1
what exactly do you mean by parse what information are you trying to retrieve,1
why are you skipping indices id use a dictionary,1
try a regex something along the lines of at2 digits to give you a rough idea your current solution is weak because it first assumes that each line is a complete string and doesnt factor in all digit possibilities,1
"i already write a tons of ideas first making a list and join the spliting  i get something like a1a10 but i cannot access to a or 1 after maybe using the string and using their access but i get confused to check ex my string can be

if you are getting a compile time exception then that means there is some wrong code present in your program which is not letting it compile so if possible please post your code that way people here can help you,1
it could be php but im not pretty sure i would also want to know what language he is using if you find please update me too thanks,1

"  jimenez
okay it is really long though",1
  i dont use breaks either do you use rects instead of sprites,1
do you also have a question ,1
yes it doesnt show list view,1
you are correct it doesnt show the list view due to the exception that you have demonstrated  please ensure you include the actual question you are wanting answered so we can help further,1
errors are clearly shown in the error stack ,1
i know theyre telling me the erros but these errors simply dont exist,1
you need to define the enum first and then use them in the function declaration you have reversed the order,1
what does please dont vote this down for absolutely no reason with your software problem please reread help→tourhttpstackoverflowcomtour which clearly states no distractions no chitchat,1
even if you resolve the above errors you will be left with two more similar errors  enum door  first1 second third  door lastpicknull  you cannot use the enum like above,1
unfortunately though compilers are very good at assembling machine code from wellformed source code they are remarkably bad at assembling errormessages  all of them are bad and linkers worse  one syntax error can generate pages of utter rubbish as the compiler digs itself an everbigger hole often the only thing you can do is look at the first line flagged as erroneous carefully examine it and mess about until you find out what is really causing the problem eg using enums before declaring them,1
you start to count at 0 not 1 your array has 10 elements but the last one has the index 9 not 10,1
first thanks for these message then ive to say that im a real begginer in the world of developement i know there is some problem and i want to improve myself also im sorry if i wasnt clear in my explication will try to correct this  anyway i will try to see what you say stefan,1
if you had to enter the number of children you plan to have do you think you need decimals there or will a natural number no decimals suffice  next to this there are performance reasons,1
floats and doubles also have a lot of precision problems that integers do not have,1
in addition to stultuskes comment floating point arithmetics are a bit of a nightmare,1
some of the bits in floating point numbers are used for an exponent so the range of integer values of a float which is 32 bits is smaller than the range of an int 32 bits for instance this linkhttpukmathworkscomhelpmatlabrefflintmaxhtml says that the largest consecutive integer in ieee single precision is 16777216 224 which is far smaller than the largest integer in an equivalent integer type  2147483647 231  1,1
  realy good example,1
you can keep any integer number in a variable of type doubletry to compare double5000000000000l and double4999999999999l to see why youre wrong,1
more details would be highly appreciated and would help to solve your problem,1
is there something else you think it should be have you tried simply going through the sequence of steps the program would perform,1

i didnt downvote but i dont understand your question,1
i am looking for something like documentinnerhtml cause documentdocumentelementouterhtmldoes not return the expected result,1
i updated the question to make it more precise hopefully and if you downvoting people would please just leave a comment why you downvoted it will help me improving the question thank you,1
i think it returns the expected result but maybe not the desired result  so i assume your problem is the comments outside the html elements,1
i understand the answer is unhelpful especially since the question is also tagged c however by providing the length of the string in another variable you effectively make zeroterminated strings capable of everyhting lengthprefixed strings are capable of with the same performance,1
at that point its not a null terminated string its a string prefixed by a length and good luck passing that thing around,1
use settimeout search for it,1
if you had a bug while using it please reproduce your problem and show us the relevant code,1
well if you want to call teh function after 13 seconds then it should not be 13000 just use 13000 no minus,1
based on your edit it may appear to be stuck because startcalculation isnt doing very much it looks up the price element then reassigns the variable to another elementss innerhtml discarding the element and doing nothing more with the html perhaps you meant something like elementvalue  windowvinnerhtml,1
you also need to wrap that in a windowonloadfunction,1

add a space in the macro eg define operator10  define operator 10 and do the same for the other macros,1
the compiler gives you the line no with error descriptionquite sufficient to understand,1
please consistently indent the code for readability by us humans  suggest 4 spaces after every opening brace  and unindent before every closing brace ,1
the compiler is telling you exactly what line the error usually syntax error is on and what the error is   suggest enabling line number on your editor go to the indicated line fix the syntaxspellingwhatever,1
white space between tokens is almost always necessary  white space between code blocks makes code much easier for us humans to read,1
regarding this line returnsymbol0symbol symbolt 0 is not normally considered a white space characters  however n is considered white space,1
always indent with spaces not tabs   this is because tabs are not a consistent width  the actual width depends on the settings of the individual word processor or editor,1
now i have only one error 120 error syntax error before  token,1
the header file conioh is not portable suggest removing that line replacing clrscr with systemcls replacing getch with getchar,1
the system function gets is depreciated due to its many problems and soon to removed from the c language  suggest using fgets,1

hey now i have only one  error syntax error before  token    can you find solution for this,1

if you have javascript thats executable by a browser then anyone using your page can view and see what it is too  if you want to keep things secret dont send them to the client,1

what are you trying to remove only instances of floatright any float style all styles except width,1
i would like to remove all the floats and leave the width there are more than one float in the documents html that i am using,1
this is an extremely weak form of security if the content is given to the client by the server then you have to assume the userattacker can access it regardless of whether or not its present in the dom all authorization logic must be enforced by the server,1

i don’t get it in your previous questionhttpstackoverflowcomq311851872711488 you have been told that the code does not work this way why are you bringing it up again there are no fields named class in your class,1
  1 i did not get the meaning of 1  class              2              annotationtypeexample 2 i clearly did not understand when class member comes into existence,1
constant pool entries are nothing special they are just constant pool entries 1 could have been 39123 and it would have worked just fine its referred to by the field thisclass in the class file format to indicate the name of this class and class is not a member but an expression and it does not come into existence,1
there is no member named “class”,1
what is the question do you have any special problem errors and how does the method where this code comes from look like,1
the right syntax is if balance  0  balance  10000,1
please post all relevant code so that we can compile and run our tests,1
id suggest you read a tutorial on the ifelse constructhttpsblogudemycomcsharpifelse,1
and one on httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask,1
  i have edited my answer with relevant code,1
i dont think balancerange is clearly named for a function that checks an amount for validity and it should not set the balance but just return a bool,1
also c has properties so you can have public balance  get  return balance   instead of get and set functions,1

what is the issue you are facing,1
this means the instance of the class that you are in,1
it is mainactivity class from the from mainactivityjava file which is automatically created when we start new app in android studio  ,1
read my answer then,1
when you reopen the app wont same code get executed again and button would be created,1
no when reopen the app i want to see the  button created last time,1
how do you know if its a newly created button or the old one,1
in test i created a button  i can see it and use it but after reopen the app the button disappear,1
well i dont think its possible adding button from xml is probably the best idea,1
ok so i can just use the setvisibility method right,1
can you give us a more info like what the buttons are supposed to do or why would you need those buttons created on the fly,1
i an trying  to build albums and thats why i need the buttons still there after reopen,1
because there is a comma in your test string,1
did you try googling anything about the split method,1
er editrecordsno,1
try editrecordsno,1
you can assign it to a variable var variablesno then pass variable to other function,1
actual that is global variable it increase for every row i try editrecordsno but it takes global variable valuelast row value  ,1
 li ah i think you want to pass the variable to the function everytime it changes without calling the function again,1
i try like that also its not working uncaught referenceerror variable  is not definedonclick  assignment2html1  ,1
  doodler he want to pass sno to other function may be sno is not global variable he can declare a global variable and assign sno to that variable,1
why are you using sno in onclickeditrecordsno,1
you can also write onclickeditrecord,1
it is totally unclear what are you asking please explain in more detail,1
how about sobjectsfilterrpgivenp ,1

besides i havent found it on google or any booksall the articles were based on cso im asking is there any way to do it,1
how about  you try something first and then come back and ask a specific question if you get stuck on something,1
first try to think of the steps you need to take to solve this problem then try to solve each step and if you get stuck at one step come back and ask a question about this specific step,1
but i hv explicitly specified the digit places,1
please edit the question and add the code there longer strectches of code arent very readable in comment markup,1
now that you have posted the code do you see a pattern could there something be gained by switching from explicit variable names like n1 n2 n3 and so on to an array with n0 n1 etc take care your output is in the wrong order,1

  also you can never know what apple decides to change with the next versions of ios even 1px difference would break this,1
this answer is really poor advice you should rarely rely on magic numbers in general programming and almost never  in ui programming apple frequently changes the size of ui elements just look at ios 11 with major changes to title elements  if you dont have direct access to the element info then set up an auto layout constraint to that element and use the values from the constraint for your calculations,1

why dont you measure it,1
look at the generated assembly it may be the same i dont actually know,1
it depends on the processor compiler settings and context,1
if theres a difference it will probably favor the version using the or theres unlikely to be any difference though,1
they are only equivalent if c is an array of unsigned char if it is then the compiler can probably figure out the optimal version for the platform if its not then you are either relying on extra information to guarantee your cs are between 0 and 255 or theyre not equivalent either way the answer of which is faster will depend on the platform,1

im a student now not developeri hope im a developer in future ,1
i understand i found my fault  thanks everybody,1
you are kind of right but at the same time this does not provide any help since you can still have instances of protocols by downcasting a instance of a class conforming to the protocol,1
  you can compare references to instances of class not instances of protocol type even though someone dont agree that is the reality you are not able to create a instance of protocol,1
  downcasting doesnt change dynamictype downcasting can help you to work with the type as it is an instance of protocol hiding all class or struct  specific implementation but you still have an instance of original dynamictype,1
ok dear downvoters please provide me an example how to create reference to protocol this should be the first step to compare two references,1
although i have not down voted you yet i believe you are getting down votes because you do not answer the question you are just saying protocols do not have instances which is not the problem here,1
   operator compare references reference means that you have an instance you are not able to create an instance of protocol that means you are not able use  operator for protocols,1
it does not matter if the protocol itself is an instance  the point is to check if  2 instances that conform to a protocol are the same instance so if class a and class b both conform to protocol p they can still be compared to see if they are indeed the same instance,1
  you can but you are responsible to cast the reference to the same reference type,1
that is not the same thing  you cant cast class b to class a  you will get errors,1
  see my last example please,1

deleting a file on someone elses computer is probably illegal  deleting someone elses file on a shared system without authorization is probably illegal  the determining factor is whether you are authorized to do this  actually you are more likely to get into trouble with your school than the police but you need to be aware of what the law says is in your state  country,1
yea  and asking other people to help you with an illegal activity is called a conspiracy in some legal jurisdictions,1

why are you using the c tag,1
which tag should i use for this question,1
  the tag that fits the question c,1
your main problem here is that you dont compile your program with enough warnings enabled,1
what did you try ,1

ok it seems you need to make a list of sorted sublists what have you tried so far,1
this is not really a question please provide text,1
  ghodaskar you saw my answer,1
do you know the difference between interfaces and classes,1
set is interface and hashset is class which implements set,1
you use a set if you want to create your own set because it´s an interface,1

like text in input field,1
i suggest you read mdnhttpsdevelopermozillaorgenusdocsweb if you need a tutorial,1
one is comparison the other is assignment,1
im really tempted at closing your question as a duplicate of this one considering its the same mistake httpstackoverflowcomquestions1642028whatisthenameoftheoperator im not interested in seeing a new so question for every way you can combine an operator,1
in fact this should be retitled to not equals vs assigned not value,1
  this allows for different search results edited it if you like,1
i have edited to add a little context,1
what is the specific rule what have you tried,1
i havent tried anything since i dont know how to do it,1
given the information youve provided simple assignment would be sufficient s  hello,1
so only uppercase e to lowercase e x  xreplacee e,1
what if the string is unknown but the second character of the string must be in lowercase,1
then thats a different problem than youve mentioned so far and would have a different solution,1
why dont you figure out what you actually want to know then edit your question to ask that  so far youve asked three different questions two of which arent even in your question but only in the comments,1
1 and 3 are the same 2 is completely different,1
this link shows more information about this httpsfacebookgithubioreactdocsglossaryhtml,1
this is actually wrong element is not an instance element is a description,1
this blog post explain element and component httpsfacebookgithubioreactblog20151218reactcomponentselementsandinstanceshtml,1
what is the exact problem what have you tried so far please show some of your attempts,1
you can edit your post to include some code you have tried so far and sample output format your code by selecting it and pressing ctrlk,1
in the current state it is unclear what you are asking,1
its a negative sign,1
please read one of the books in the introductory section herehttpstackoverflowcomq3882422069064 they will help you a lot more at this time than so,1
so you know its an operator so why not start by searching for c operatorshttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrary6a71f45daspx  first result will point you to herehttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysa7629ewaspx the  operator is also used to specify a method that will be called in response to an event such methods are called event handlers the use of the  operator in this context is referred to as subscribing to an event ,1
you may not be familiar with vbnet but in case you are it is equivalent to an addhandler statement,1
why do you think something is wrong please read ask a proper question,1

why are you using an input as a link just use a proper a tag,1
as   asked why are you using input tag the attribute target will only works with an a tag,1
the reason why this one will not work is that isinstanceof does a runtime check based on the type information available to the jvm and that runtime information will not contain the type argument to list because of type erasure,1
 is binary xor in ruby so 23  23 but 23  1,1
thats just unnecessary looping why would you not index it directly,1
why are you defining currentpope as a list when it becomes a string in the loop furthermore why are you even defining that variable before the loop,1
just a friendly tip you may want to read over this page the howtoask guidehttpsstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask so you can always be sure that your questions are easily answerable and as clear as possible be sure to include any efforts youve made to fix the problem youre having and what happened when you attempted those fixes also dont forget to your show code and any error messages,1

it is compiling its failing at runtime,1
not sure whats up but i think your stack trace explicitly says what your error is in this line arrij  innextint,1
itd be nice to indicate in the source which is the line mentioned in the exception,1
and next step would be look at the javadocs of the library method which throws the exception in this case javautilscannernextint to see why it throws that exception then if you dont understand it though in this case it seems clear enough in the docs you might ask that what does it mean when nextint throws nosuchelementexception,1
you should check if there is another element in the collection before trying to do innextint usually you would use a whileinhasnextint as your iterator instead of a for loop javautilnosuchelementexception is thrown at runtime thats why your code compiles,1
are you sure that was the full output of gcc,1
see if the file is present  try versbose option wlverbose for additional information like where is the linker searching for the linker script  if there is the file see what permissions are ls al might help,1

this is an unorthodoxed version of an assignment operator  an assignment operator should do one thing and one thing only and that is to create a copy of the passed in object to an existing object  it shouldnt be performing business logic such as simplify,1
  i dont agree if we assume that simplify doesnt semantically change the value that is being assigned merely optimises its representation then invoking it is absolutely fine it would be rather like stdstring trimming its capacity on swap its not business logic hate that term the real problem with the ops function is that its a nonmember operator taking just one operand and not even trying to assign anything to what should be the lhs operand,1
what do you mean whats the significance of memory object,1
why do you think that abcdef will be in the string pool,1
nope abcdef will not go into string constants pool,1
also abcdef will be candidate for garbagecollection because youre not assigning the result of concat to any variable concat doesnt modify the string it creates a new one,1
i know about that thats why i asked,1
  its referencing only to the string pool then why make two objects one in heap and one in string pool while initiating first,1
  abcdef will go in string pool because thats how out bm handles string,1
  abcdef will go in string pool please check some basic java resources,1
  very true but its referencing only to the string pool then why make two objects one in heap and one in string pool while initiating first,1
   i am not talking about the string literal abcdef i am talking about the string abcdef generated by s1concatdef i assure you it does not go into string constats pool,1
  thats basicsthanks anyways i will find out that one for a little proof,1
"   
string s1  new stringabc now do s1concatdef  there is a change in object so sops1 should be abcdef not abc please check first and then do reply",1
   string s1  new stringabc now do s1concatdef  there is a change in object so sops1 should be abcdef not abc please check first and then do reply,1
why dont you test by yourself first btw you were already told twice that concat doesnt change the string it creates and returns a new one sops1 will not print abcdef it will print abc,1
  i am asking you a very simple question ie at object creation if we wrote strinf s1 new stringabc then there be object formation total 2 objects s1 is referencing to object of pool or object of memoryjvm not pool whats the significance of other object,1
now do s1concatdef  there is a change in object so youre telling us that concat changes the immutable string s1 even the javadochttpdocsoraclecomjavase7docsapijavalangstringhtmlconcat28javalangstring29 proves you wrong,1

int  employee,1
  not really since all they need to do is define an implicit cast on the employee class,1
   i specifically meant the way in which he tried ,1
note that boxinghttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibraryyz2be5wkaspx is defined as the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type  so attempting to cast to a reference type other than object even if there is an implicit cast operator would not be considered boxing,1

before your c program even gets to main it needs to load and initialize the c library and do a bunch of other stuff you could change your assembly version to use main too and link it with the c library so you get a more fair comparison alternatively you could compile the c version as standalone code,1

thanks thats the mistake i did,1
what you have tried so far,1
unsurprisingly it is  the quotes are not part of the regexp,1
i tried everything you advised but sadly nothing works ,1
the replace method takes a string and returns a string it does not affect the source string at all so make sure you are assigning the result of the call to something,1
please have a look here it works fine with replaceall httpideonecomtxueln,1
strings are immutable so you cant change them you can only produce a new string,1

the code you already have is not even valid swift,1
before you post code samples please make sure they compile  run in a playground,1
what are you trying to achieve,1
its not clear what you want to do your two functions dont return a value but they only print it on the screen if you want to sum the two values that you send as parameters to those functions you simply have to call sum24 which would be implemented as void sumint aint breturn ab there is no need for function pointers and if you want to use them for exercise its not clear how you want to use them,1
the short answer is you cannot because the functions do not return anything and a function pointer alone also cannot tell you what parameters are passed to the functions,1
  which would be implemented as  you missed to change the return type to int,1

you cant do it because the language doesnt support it or am i missing something,1

the language doesnt support it because it is an awful idea consider your example does if int i evaluate to true or false,1
why would you do that ,1
your worrying about memory is also unfounded,1
why not include the script using the url why do you want to write it to a div,1

that is the expected behviour getscript returns an object,1

is it possible   ,1
are you trying to get the code from the cdn then print it in a div,1
i am trying to get the http request response and put it in a div  is that possible ,1
i think that it would be impossible to get response without requesting through xmlhttprequest,1
afaik getscripturl gets the script and executes it you will have access to the variables in the script but not the source itself,1
 ñamaque what if i get response without xhr ,1
   thank you i believe your comment is the most helpful here,1
so   what is it that youre trying to do your question is unclear please elaborate,1

i would strongly recommend you read a book on c,1
to gain more memory you use realloc,1
  that wouldnt work here as realloc requires an initialized pointer to start with,1
"you are overwriting random memory areas that you did not reserved not only you can corrupt data but also you have no guarantee that you will be able to retrieve the data you wrote
more likely you will end up in a segfault because this is undefined behavior",1
  yes my point is to gain more you have to have something first so malloc is not to gain more it is realloc but malloc should be used first,1
  kim it is a splendid idea i like it let the compiler bothers about allocating memory somewhere where it likes,1
  kim your program would look even better if you add one minor detail including a word in the print statement for example  printfenter the maximum number of money you want ,1
  false realloc when passed a null pointer behaves like malloc,1
  but that would change the meaning maybe he wants to know what is the maximum number you want to have maybe its a count von count emulatord,1
  null is a value uninitialized pointers arent null and null pointers are initialized eg msvc will set uninitialized pointers to 0xcdcdcdcd in debug mode so you can spot the bug,1

did you try doing man printf try google the first link youll see is httplinuxdienetman3printf why dont you read it once,1
  the 1 is the minimum field width  in this format you cant get less than 5 characters generated because the exponent is printed with e a sign and 2 digits plus at least one digit before the exponent so the width is functionally ignored here  the 4 does mean 4 decimal places  if you changed the conversion specification to 104en youd get 31416e01 and using 134en youd get    31416e01 note that e formats always print just one digit before the decimal point,1

isnt that a bit like building a car by trying to assemble all the plastic bits then all the metal bits then all the rubber bits ,1
your structure is indeed the most important thing as it focuses on the content if you ever redesign your site you only need to change css and js and not the whole thing so html first then css as some people use your site with javascript disabled then javascript  javascript should be icing on the cake not the main focus,1
"there is no one best way to make a website because it is personal preference but it is always good to plan out beforehand exactly what you plan on putting in the website drawings mockups animation sketches if you dont have much experience with designing websites i would then suggest completely writing up the html not simply with divs but using good html practices such as this httpistackimgurcomb73dvjpg

then take your time designing the elements in css and javascript once you have a full skeleton of html to work on and mockups to lead your way",1
you shouldnt have to rewrite all your css if you change your code youre doing css wrong if you do,1

welcome to stack overflow questions seeking debugging help why isnt this code working must include the desired behavior a specific problem or error and the shortest code necessary to reproduce it in the question itself questions without a clear problem statement are not useful to other readers see how to create a minimal complete and verifiable examplehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,1
did you really write iostream also main needs an int return type,1
no i dont need an int return type thats why i dont know how to do it,1
let me rephrase main has to have an int return type it is a rule so write int main you dont actually have to return anything from the function because main has an implicit return 0,1
this one 0  105  10 is the same as 0  105  10 and gets the expected value by chance both true  10 and false  10 will display true,1
your text editor has nothing to do with your issues for starters probably not wise to use spaces in filenames you probably dont want to use local paths finally i understand you are a beginner but i think you may need to do a few more tutorials for both html and js you have some malformed html and your js has a lot of issues check your browser console f12 and look into those errors,1
could you clarify what you mean by this call doesnt work do you mean the call to program if so what output does it produce as compared to the output that you anticipate it should produce,1
  actually i bet its harder to find than you think its easy when you know the answer cos you know what to search for for a new programmer this behaviour is a surprise and they dont know what to search for he says he looked a lot  i believe him,1
  i looked it up bing actually and all that came up was things like how to call external programs from a c program and how to call c c etc programs for a c program,1
  ill edit an update,1
    well the compiler error is probably a good place to start  program was not declared in this scope,1
  tew  note that calling program from inside program is not the way to go you should use a while loop,1
  yes this is an example though of course in an actual program i would use a dowhile loop,1
also why am i receiving so many negative votes i feel this is an appropriate question for this forum,1
  its not a forum to be technical about it,1
are the 3 classes in the same file,1
you dont youre trying to execute adder try running sol,1
no its not compulsory to define a main method in a class that extends an abstract class there might be some other issues,1
also it may be possible that you are trying to execute adder you must have to execute sol,1
  am actually executing the sol class which says to define main method in adder class,1
please use public in front of your static void mainstring atgs as if you donnt use public this will make defaultand not be called by jvm,1
public static void mainstring args is the standard main signature which the compiler looks for,1
  have u tried after using public in front of main,1
  yeah it worked fine now thanks dude,1
   actually the compiler doesnt look for it  the compiler doesnt care if there is a main method at all  it is the java command that looks for the main method,1
i have done just now but i think ive messed up each method with the above options in is just returning 0 they do complile though which is the main thing i guess,1
i know its a shocker kocko i apologise just clutching at straws here,1
it is always 0 that is very strange since you never set a value to x there is absolutely no possible way that x has its default value ,1
think ive completely messed up the test class i just made,1
maybe you can provide something more to have a minimum working example mwe,1

i know how to use timespan to get the difference but how to set the limit using seconds and switch to mintues this is where i need help,1
help would imply you have posted code which gives us a starting point,1
take a look at the momentjs library or the livestampjs library  i think youll find what you need there,1
"  if you are familiar with what you say the you should be familiar with the following timespan duration property and if you create an instance of timespan object then you can get at the following for example 
tsdurationdays 
tsdurationhours 
tsdurationminutes
tsdurationseconds as well as txdays tshours tsminutes tsseconds",1
  yes i am familiar with that but howwhen to let it choose what to return based on difference value for example if the difference between dates is 120 mintues i do not want it to return it 120 mintues i want it to return 2 hours  how to make this switch ,1
check this out for starters and there are several examples on so as well i actually used one today and it worked most amazingly httpwwwdotnetperlscomstopwatch,1
why the downvote,1
have the function return a value and decide what to do in the calling function based on that value,1
looks like c exception at some point,1
   the question is not whether it makes sense to you the goal obviously is error handling i am hoping to achieve the interruption of a deep call chain without having to check return values,1
what do you mean by portable i know that gcc has a feature for goto across functions but wont work on other compilers,1
   it seems applicable in this scenario but it is just a small example and is not applicable in the scenario i intend to use it,1
   i added gcc as a tag to specify it is a given so by portable i mean platform portability while still using gcc,1
why is your idea simpler of better then simply returning a value from foo and having bar either return or execute somewhereelse conditionally  the point is your example does not justify the mechanism when sensible design using basic mechanisms of the language suffice in your example situation  more generally perhaps c exception handling is what you need,1
   yes it is just an example its point is to illustrate what i want to achieve not how it makes sense in actual code unfortunately i cannot use c,1
you are reinventing longjmp if you want that to be portable and general and compatible with recursive functions,1
   well not all of our systems come with a spare 150 gigs of ram to afford to be reasonable with a billion longjmps,1
a billion longjmp  will generally use a constant memory space of a hundred bytes they wont even spend a single megabyte and the billion calls to longjmp will require a few seconds in total each of them lasting a few dozens of nanoseconds,1
   somehow and amazingly so you are still missing the point that it is about error handling and achieving in practice stack unwingding so those billion jumps will require a billion buffers in fact the buffers will end up being there even if no jumps are made so to my question about zero cost error handling you are answering with a solution with an impossible cost,1
no my improved answer show that there is no billion buffer in heap only one single jmpbuf  temporarily on the call stack,1
so how do you trace back your n  1 number of steps with only one jump buffer nobody is talking about heap but the deeper you go the more buffers you leave behind so you can make the jump if you have to you can at best limit it to one buffer for each stack frame reusing the same buffer if there are more than one error prone operations per frame,1
please read more about longjmp it can unwind dozens of thousands of call frames in constant time and most call stacks dont have that much a typical call stack cannot exceed a few megabytes on most laptops,1
i am well aware of the typical stack sizes but even though the stack as a memory buffer is a flat object what happens inside has a tree structure storing a jump buffer on every frame in a deep call chain will run out of stack space in no time since even if the buffer only stores a few registers it is still a constant size construct might have been nice if the compiler actually trimmed it down to only what is needed to store a particular state,1
see my example you dont store a jmpbuf in most call frames only in some initial ones,1
as a caution lets keep this discussion civil and avoid pointed comments about other users,1
  if you dont store each of the steps then the stack unwinding will not collect all the objects in between it will all leak which is why your solution is utterly useless the goal is not to get back to where you started it is to do so and properly collect all objects along the call stack this will require a lot of jump buffers and will result in massive cpu and memory overhead,1
you could provide the code you have already written and point out where you are struggeling this would make it more likely that you´ll be getting an answer,1
youll do better here if you post code and ask questions about specific difficulties  this isnt a haz the codez site,1
how may it fail if 2 strings are given as parameters isnt there only 3 options about a comparison between them,1
how do you imagine a situation that it fails except when a null pointer is passed otherwise its just a comparison that returns how the strings compares,1
it will fail if the strings arent null terminated,1
the only ways strcmp can fail are if you pass one or two null pointers or if the strings are not properly null terminated but they need to be similar chunks of data because strcmp stops as soon as theres a difference   however that invokes undefined behaviour so anything can happen and it is valid,1
do you understand the difference between a keyword and a function call,1
yes i understand what i wanna know is how compiler handles int char etc ,1
a fundamental type is not a function it does not need to be declared its fundamental nor do basic keywords need to be declared how would you declare such things without using basic keywords,1
with all due respect no you dont please read a basic c book first,1
the compiler knows how to handle basic types and keywords because their behaviour is specified by the standard and the compiler must implement this behaviour using whichever resources are available on the architecture used for compilation this is circular logic the compiler must know how to do such basic things otherwise it couldnt compile,1
thats what i wanna know  how the compiler knows ,1
are you asking about how a compiler knows the spec for the supported language,1
printf is not defined in a header but only declared,1
languages have grammar constructs sometimes types and keywords functions are build using these things that make up a language printf is a function return is a keyword int and char are types the basic format of a function is defined by the grammar ie returntype name args  function body  compiling an expression like int a doesnt call a function its simply using the language printf is invoking a function if the compiler doesnt know about that function theres a problem its pretty obvious isnt it,1
  a compiler is just another program it reads input your code and processes it according to a set of builtin rules  it recognizes keywords like int and char and return because it was written to recognize those things,1
this example does not show any use of exception filters,1
this is standard way to filter exception in c60,1
take a look again at what exactly exception filters are you are not using an exception filter in your example theres a proper example in this answerhttpstackoverflowcoma22864936247702 posted a year before yours,1
an example of exception filtering would be catch httpexception e when egethttpcode  400  writelinebad request ,1
this does not show a way to filter exceptions ,1

myfunction should return an int,1
the writeline meth is is trying to output a value but myfunction isnt returning a value the return value is void,1
which language are you using make up your mind c or c,1
i was using c but then a friend suggested to me the swapab and that seemed to be c and it lost me because ive never used that command before,1
its incredibly easy to make your own swap function id suggest doing that and editing out c from your question,1
your main routine is defining and initializing deck but does nothing beyond that so what is your expected behaviour,1
yeah i just took out the c portion from it how could i make a swap function in my case this program can be run on visual studio 2013 the command prompt just doesnt have anything except press any key to continue and i cant figure out whats wrong,1
  uhh it seems you already have a swap function you wrote its in your code,1
is there anything else that could be added to my main i didnt know what else to put besides my array,1
  like i said though a friend suggested me to use it but i had never used it before,1
  im confused the swap function in your program doesnt depend on c its valid c code,1
possible duplicate of programming homework deck of cards dealt to players  c programminghttpstackoverflowcomquestions36705850programminghomeworkdeckofcardsdealttoplayerscprogramming,1
  thats not a duplicate thats another post that i made earlier today when i read the comments and realized my structure was completely off i didnt know how to fix it i decided to try a different approach to the assignment,1
  in that question you were calling functions in main but not here now,1
i will try and fix my main problem thanks for the feedback everyone,1
this code doesnt even compile because the number of arguments in the definition of distributecards doesnt match the number of arguments in the declaration of the prototype before,1
disagree with every and single line of the answer same comments were made for strict aliasing optimizations and those hopefully are dismissed now the solution is to educate developers not prevent optimizations based on bad development habits,1
it is a reasonable thing to argue that the standard is broken regarding this being allowed to be null for nonvcalls i dont necessarily agree but thats a fine opinion to hold for other optimizations eg the felixgcc one it is very hard to teach a compiler what is ok to optimize and what a human intended that is architecturally very unclean and might be practically impossible linus torvalds has made the same error once about an optimized out null check,1
pretty much every realworld program is undefined  not sure what is the basis of this claim the systems i work with do not rely on undefined behaviour and when such is discovered because people make mistakes it is treated as bug and fixed rather than blaming it on the compiler,1
  you can turn on that behavior using a switch and i would not condemn you for doing that i find the idea of safer versions of c and c very useful but it costs your performance in certain loops c generally is a language that is supposed to be so close to the metal that there is not enough room below c and above assembler for another language,1
  the problem with a switch is it is old code which needs that behaviour that is the code where by definition the makefile does not have the switch because it did not exist when the code was written,1
  actually those who argue against this kind of optimization want semantics which are closer to the metal,1
  semantics close to the metal but performance removed from the metal signed overflow allows you to conclude in for int i  0 i  n i that i  0 not wrapping and even n  0 apparently that is useful for certain optimizations this is what i read,1
  i am not taking sides here but i found this paper also via fefe interesting in that regard httpwwwcomplangtuwienacatkps2015proceedingskps2015submission29pdf,1
  again again this is about preexisting code not new code new code should avoid ub but new compiler versions should not break existing code,1
  that tight loop which is 30 to 40 faster because it assumes no integer overflow might be the loop which is copying the exploit over your return address on the stack,1
  for preexisting code if the user is allowed and able to compile from source common practice has been to allow the user to specify the compiler and the compiler flags to use this gives the user the ability to add options to disable specific optimisations without having to change the makefile or the code,1
  no it isnt common practice is to use the latest compiler for each new release im glad you versioncontrol your compiler and bdiff the different versions looking for breaking changes in the compiled output before upgrading but most people just dont,1
  youve read my comment just barely enough to type up a response to it but clearly not nearly enough to understand what i wrote you were saying that for preexisting code there is no way that their makefiles specify any options needed to make it work that did not exist at the time im saying that those makefiles do typically specify that the user can provide custom options your response to that totally misses my point its not about how many developers  users make use of that ability its merely about the ability being there when you say its not,1
  i understand that the user can specify options needed to make it work and for an automated build system you can set these options as a global default i get it my point is that by default there is no reason for them to believe that there is any need for them to do it there are no new warnings produced it just compiles how can they know that actually there is a breaking change there they dont read the compiler release notes they assume the compiler writer is on their side unfortunately it seems he is not breaking changes need to be optin not optout,1
step number one in writing robust correct code is to know your tools  someone who was so wholly unacquainted with their language as to mess this up is not producing secure code no matter how much help they get from the compiler  the security vulnerabilities were introduced by having incompetent programmers write the code not by the compiler upgrade,1
  and what do you think that code was doing before,1
simply recompiling previously working secure code with a newer version of the compiler can introduce security vulnerabilities  that always happens unless you want to mandate that one version of one compiler is the only compiler that will be allowed for the rest of eternity   do you remember back when the linux kernel could only be compiled with exactly gcc 2721  the gcc project even got forked because people were fed up with bullcrap  it took a long time to get past that,1
also relevant gcc warns about this httpcolirustackedcrookedcomadd3a1326e3e26097 really if you recompile with a newer compiler dont even have warnings enabled dont have tests and so fall for this you dont deserve sympathy fix your code fix your build system fix your workflow,1
  id really prefer that the c standard wasnt written by google to prevent that we have to hold google accountable for writing bad code rather than shift the responsibility onto compiler vendors and the standards committee to accommodate googles errors,1
 t hes still out there ranting against gcc specifically about this very issue we are discussing here httpblogfefedetsa9de792d,1
  were that the way things should be chrome and firefox wouldnt have become wildly popular by sticking rigidly to the standards putting an end to the torture of the hack browser wars and leading directly to the web renaissance we enjoy today,1
working code no relying on null dereference not crashing is not working code any more than writing code with race conditions works until moores law makes it not work on a new faster computer or maybe the guys who speed up the chips are also into purity instead of sticking with what works,1
 t standard should define behavior standard which defines undefined behavior is crap so fix standard compilers and after what peoples will folliw standard but not sooner,1
httpsgistgithubcomrygorouse0f055bfb74e3d5f0af20690759de5a7 this is a nice explanation of the signed overflow issue adding this here for all interested parties to see,1
its time to debug,1
welcome to so please read httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask,1
at least be a bit specific what did you expect from the code and what did you get,1
this code isnt working what exactly isnt working error messages,1
its not performing the required function 0 error messages on the console,1
i expected the code to add a button to a div element when a value in that element is equal to focus,1
i learnt js ajax php by trial and error  well perhaps now it is time to read some documentation and tutorials,1
what is the code supposed to do please write the text in english but i guess the program should run until you type in the value stored in again thus you should never change szam only tart,1
go through each line in the code with a debugger or pen and pencil and see what the value of each variable is and you will understand also try to run your program and look at the printout does it look right,1
the program is asking the user to write a number which is not the one entered before if he writes the number which was entered before the program ends,1
yes it looks right but my teacher is saying that this isnt a global variable and it gets 0 as value  only with luck,1
the program is also running well,1
then see the answers given below,1
  teacher correct you need to initialize tart variable into integer value before use,1
 means shift left,1
  because this is standard welldocumented swift syntax,1
  i mean i understand but he is new to so and maybe swift why give someone a bad experience in such a ruthless manner lol could have explained to him how so works,1
   that would only work if you limited the number of upvotes too if 10 people come along and upvote the question yet 9 out of 10 people hadnt downvoted as it was already downvoted the result vote count of 9  would make it look like a good questions the system only really works if all votes are recorded and everyone votes honestly,1
i completely agree   but i just want to point out that although 10 people downvoted not a single one had time to really comment why this question is bad,1
true and that issue downvote with no comments has been addressed on meta it seem logical to me that perhaps a comment should be required but others think not,1
what is the contents of the file what do you think happens if the strings you read are longer than 8 and 7 characters respectively note that those sizes i mentioned leaves space for the string terminator in your arrays,1
a little advice never blame the compiler ive found maybe 5 actual compiler bugs in my lifetime while my own errors are beyond counting,1
bug is in your code not visual studio your fscanf invocations do not account for strings of arbitrary length dont use what you cannot control remove the tagc tag and the c code just as well,1
maybe d1 andor d2 are too small,1
bugs in compilers are very very very rare,1
first learn to check your input ie the stuff youve read from the file then talk about compiler bugs,1
are d1 and d2 widths enough to store the cstring null terminator after strings chars,1
"dont ge me wrong i am  definitely not saying the problem is from the compiler i am just trying to know what i did wrong since it works with one and not the other

0003510 0000000 that is the line i am trying to read in the file

when compiled with cl it reads it and print it but crashes right after

i also tried to record it as a c file and to compile with cl but the problem is the same and yes i remove every c library in the include section before",1
does the problem disappear if you make d1 and d2 larger,1
what is the error message upon crashing,1
  if youre doing things more advanced than this and it doesnt work in vs it can save a lot of time to check early on and see if its a known vs bug or simply unimplemented c feature  ive wasted hours trying to figure out what i did wrong when vs simply cant deal with something like nested lambdas with auto return types,1

  as ive mentioned im trying to understand the method mentioned in that book to convert recursive into iterative ill add some examples showing where ive got stuck,1
  ive referenced the book so people who already read and understood that part of the book could help explaining how to apply the method onto a simple set of python examples the book uses a different agnostic language i dont understand why youre saying the question is not appropiate for stackexchange imho this question is like trying to solve some doubts after reading some mathematical method and then making some references to such theorem ie cooley–tukey fft algorithm linking one of the many papersbooks talking about wouldnt be in that case appropriate neither,1
that particular point turns on whether the referenced information is publicly available or small enough to include,1
  ive asked the author if it was alright to post this type of question here and she didnt mind to post it now i have been posting stuff in so for few weeks already and i still dont understand why the question ive formulated in this post which is very interesting and relevant has got negative votes and no answers at all and other trivial questions out there become really popular among people very fast,1
in my opinion the lack of approval and lack of response are because this is not yet a selfcontained question  for comparison we can easily find references on line for ackermanns function the binomial function and the others referenced  what we cannot find easily is section 43  right now your audience is limited to people who have read and understood chapter 4 and are willing to give you a tutorial on it  tutorials are generally beyond the scope of so,1

apart from what other already told you 1 isintimeslot should not be a promise 2 youd better user libs like momentjs instead of dealing w timestamps on your own,1
this is not interview questioni have doubt i postedthats it,1
how many time choose the correct answer is written in question,1
answer is option 3 alphabetagammatera,1
it is not clear which sql dialect youre referring to should we guess that as well in tsql for example it would be save transaction savepointname and rollback transaction savepointname if that question is just for mysql then please remove the sql tag,1
it is not acccessible to any webpage it is only accessible to pages in the current domain,1
  to the contrary i made a pen a while back that shows you every single keyvalue pair in your localstoragehttpcodepeniohellol11penjqlvjd without any hacks,1
nope sorry local storage is isolated perdomain code running in one domain can not access values that were stored into local storage by another domain for example googlecom stores a bunch of stuff in local storage you will not be able to list any of the keys from googlecom in your  pen example,1

why am i downvoted,1
what does that mean,1
what folder do i put the xml layouts in,1
obviously in res  layout folder,1
appreslayoutyourxmlfilexml,1
do not jump in ans start studying z instead of a start from here httpsdeveloperandroidcomtrainingindexhtml,1
i dont see the layout folder for some reason i already work in phphtml but now im adding android to my skill set because im unable to find work after time in the service,1
find that reason then or post your screen shots,1
  what have you googled so far about this issue please always show your research when asking a question,1
no clue yet as to why its not there yet,1
layout folder is just a simple folder see the comment by shashank udupahttpstackoverflowcomquestions35474305wheredoiputmylayoutinandroidstudiocomment5864326935474305 above,1
you can create layout folder too but if it is not present from start i would recommend to create another new project,1
yes i googled the issue but it wasnt coming up on top on google i hand created it now,1
right click in resnew folder name it layout thats all,1
i created it already and it didnt show up because i chose to do a blank view,1
change the view android to project,1
can i delete this question to try to remove the ban or how should i edit it to get more up votes,1
modifying the react core in order to implement an antipattern is a really bad practice,1
"so what happens say when i update my version of react or say what if im getting react from a cdn or i do some work for someone who doesnt have access my fantastically modified version of react or i want to use a plugincomponentpiece of functionality someone else built

it is a terrible idea to modify the core functionality of a library do not have control of  well said,1
pedantic overly concerned with minute details or formalisms what youre describing breaks the core rule of react not such a minute detail,1
this got 19 down votes but i think this is by far the most interesting answer question how do you trigger a ui rerender if you do it this way,1
what youre talking about here is twoway binding angular 1 had this and needed a cyclical digest basically it rerendered the dom over and over until all the data had finished propagating this is one of the main reasons why angular 1 was so slow,1
this is the only valid solution never bypass security certificate validation period,1
actually you may need bypass validation during development when you have selfsigned certificate for example,1
cant agree for example internal developement teams at my customers use special developement internal ca which is trusted within their network this helps to validate extra cert validation code as well,1
sarcasm unnecessary and there are situations in internal development where this is useful  or the net team wouldnt be spending time coding for it,1
"sometimes you have to deal with other services and these services may have invalid certificates valid at the time of development but not renewed because the developer is gone
it happens often with automated processes for invoices even with big companies and you have to deal with it so no choice there",1
yes i shall tell the outofbusiness vendor of my 8 year old heatingcontroller that they should get back in business and renew their certificate i understand the reasoning behind your post but it doesnt answer ops question and it doesnt reflect how the world actually functions,1
reformulated without the sarcasm and with background information this answer would be more useful than it is as written its unlikely to reach its target audience in particular if you dont know why disabling the certificate check is bad and what the exact impact is of doing it anyway you have no standing to go to anyone else and berate them for their ssl practices so that advice is not useful theres also a missed opportunity in explaining alternatives to completely disabling certificate checks like checking for particular certificates even if expired,1
  please note that i have had to reproduce your question here so that i could post my answer i hope it helps,1
instead of reposting the same question you can go to the close vote reviewers chatroomhttpchatstackoverflowcomrooms41570soclosevotereviewers and request reopen votes when ive done that in the past the question has been reopened within 5 minutes i appreciate what youve done here though,1
  i considered that but another five minutes work on top of ten minutes translation and forty minutes writing a solution didnt go down too well tonight take a look at answering suspended questionshttpmetastackoverflowcomquestions326227answeringsuspendedquestions,1
im voting to close this question as offtopic because it is a duplicate of httpstackoverflowcomquestions37835435theoriginalhowcanimatchvaluesinonefiletorangesfromanother,1
  pretty much any of the above depending how things pan out i suspect the original one wont be reopened and it may end up with this one being closed too but i will do all i can to assign all credit that is due having raised this on meta i now understand that pretty much the only difference with closed messages is that they may not receive answers thats supposed to be a sanction against the author to encourage them to write better questions but it hits answerers like me pretty hard when we come back after an hours work and find the gate closed,1
fair enough doesnt seem like theres any perfect way to handle it,1
 a what are you suggesting is wrong with the question,1
looks pretty much defined to me,1
what will be the length of array containing n numbers  well n,1
n elements or alength elements,1
n arrays are of a fixed size,1
if the size of an array is undefinedhttpwwwthefreedictionarycomundefined you cannot get it because it is undefined however your array very well has a definedhttpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarydefined length oh and please learn about the sizeofhttpport70netnszcc11n1570html6534p2 and array and its length ie number of elements,1
sizeof in java,1
  last time i used it sizeof was a valid c operator i see java and c tag perhaps op should add some other languages too  just for decoration,1
   oops i missed the c tag  not used to seeing both c and java tags for the same question,1
  me too but as given it can be any so op should clarify once he actually knows what he is asking but that seems to be another fireandforget question,1
after all the jesting i can inform that printfarray a length is dn sizeof a  sizeof a0 will do the job at least in c its exactly the same with b but note that i changed the narrative from size to length having said that my puzzlement about the comment size of the array may change addingdeleting elements turned to wonder even mirth since it is a fixed size array  how can you possibly keep track of its usage without another variable holding that information,1
this looks like a perfectly good question although a duplicate  of httpsstackoverflowcomquestions37538howdoideterminethesizeofmyarrayincnoredirect1lq1,1
no this is the kind of thing you do like every day,1
  i guess it depends on your workflow  in my approach i never use the index directly  when i want to save my work i just do full commits with git commit a  when i was answering this question it was because i had done an exotic inverse cherry pickhttpstackoverflowcoma162472486967 which puts files in the index for you but i wanted to edit a file before committing  i took the file out of the index while i edited it so that diffs would work the way that im used to,1
my usage case was very narrow and useless indeed create a branch add folder filled with files for branch only switch to master merge ops added wrong folder to master add it to gitignore files would not be removed from commit  granted a better solution would be just using rm straight away but i first thought switching branches wouldnt kill the ignored folder but i do use github gui based tool thats good enough for me and do support some index management except it doesnt support this so what should i use 2 guis for narrow usage still cant agree with answer,1
  i dont know about other platforms but on typical linux distros it is trivial to install these bonus gui tools  and they may come in handy for other purposes too  in any case this is just another option for people who prefer a visual approach,1
just to clarify my above comment  in the answer i suggested two tools that each support this capability  you would only need to use one of them  as a rule i am a fan of using gui toolshttpsgitscmcomdownloadguilinux with git  why would you want to manage a daghttpsenwikipediaorgwikidirectedacyclicgraph such as that created by git without the aid of visualization tools  by the way gitkhttpsgitscmcomdocsgitk and gitguihttpsgitscmcomdocsgitgui are moreorless standard equipment with git,1
this is a decidedly unpopular answer  however im quite sure that the approach i suggest is the right one for some people myself included  i use one of these tools to manipulate the index a few times per year,1
an alternative brute force approach perform a commit followed by an undohttpsstackoverflowcoma16175525,1
this guide repeatedly suggest the use of gitgui for working with the index why the indexstaging area is so usefulhttpgitolitecomusesofindexhtml,1
i would say stdstring in string,1
in python 3 the default str supports unicode which makes it quite different from stdstring,1
  stdwstring then,1
 žius there is no built in support for unicode in c  even the higher width character strings are problematic  if you need unicode in c it is best to use a library,1
  in what way does stdstring not support unicode,1
  libiconvhttpwwwgnuorgsoftwarelibcmanualhtmlnodegenericcharsetconversionhtmlgenericcharsetconversion does a pretty good job when character conversion is necessary,1
πάνταῥεῖ which reinforces my comment of best to use a library,1
  stdstringélength  2 theres no notion of encoding in a stdstring which makes it very different from pythons str,1
  which reinforces my comment of course and it was meant so as far i can see that library can be made working on serveral platforms,1
  okay i thought you were referring to the often repeated confusion that you need a wide character string to store unicode yeah youll need external functions in order to deal properly with code points but you can of course as you appear to know store unicode strings in stdstring,1
  and you can store images in stdstring but this is not supported – as unicode is not,1

you have a syntax problem in the last line span tag is malformed,1
what line breaks,1
brbr its not just line breaks that is the problem code appears out of nowhere and other code disappears and changes all i want to know is is it html or xhtml,1
possible duplicate of what is doctypehttpsstackoverflowcomquestions414891whatisdoctype,1
 öm in html 5 span elements may appear right in the body you can validate the html fragment on w3cs validatorhttpsvalidatorw3org put doctype html  and titlesome titletitle at the start to make the fragment a valid html document or alternatively using my sgml dtd for htmlhttpsgmljsnetblogblog1701html,1

  according to why is voting importanthttpstackoverflowcomhelpwhyvote you should downvote if a post contains wrong information is poorly researched or fails to communicate information please explain for which one of these reasons youve downvoted this answer,1
  two things 1 you are never owed an explanation for downvotes though i understand it can be helpful 2 i did not downvote your answer but i would guess that people dont like your answer because they think it is the wrong way to do this that would qualify it as wrong information since the question is looking for the best way to do something,1
i did not downvote you but i can certainly understand how invent yet another poorly specified format which is basically what youre saying would be seen as wrong or poorly researched,1
as others pointed out there is no standard for dates in json there is only rfc 3339 which is actually a timestamp format not a date format in particular it doesnt cover time zones but thats important for future dates time zones change more often than you might think,1
  it does cover time zones  the z indicates the time zone is utc  id downvote too but at this point theres no further need,1
  utc is not really a time zone there is no place on earth which uses utc as its official time zone its a time standardhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicoordinateduniversaltime also time zone offsets are quite unpredictable there is no way to say if in 2025 1200 moscow time is still 900 utc like it is today it has been changed a couple of times during the last 30 yearshttpsenwikipediaorgwikimoscowtimepastusage if you want to express a future local time you need true time zones,1
the mathsqrthttpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysystemmathsqrt28vvs11029aspx methods returns a double so that definitely contains the fractional part of the result how are you using it,1
it returns a double lets see what code youre running are you casting the result to an int,1
decimal is not desktop hardwares capability you need to convert it from float or double to decimal but some special cpu architecture may have ability of fixed point arithmetics in which case you need to implement your own sqrt,1
this question has several answers here httpstackoverflowcomquestions4124189performingmathoperationsondecimaldatatypeinc,1
the duplicate is not appropriate since the question has now clearly nothing to do with the decimal type reopening so a better decision can be made,1
you are converting to int32 which truncates the decimal places,1
youre clearly converting the result of the mathsqrt to an int32  an integer ie no decimals,1
  you should use int instead of int32 and i cant see what for you need the decimal when dealing with ints also converting the c value to int will loose precision in most cases i suggest to used double for c,1
did you run it and find out did you run it i a debugger what confuses you,1
please see httpsenwikipediaorgwikicommaoperator,1
voted to reopen the question is closed with the reason does not contain  a mcve  but in fact it does contain a mcve,1
  rules of sequence points or sequencing in c11 are also required which are usually explained poorly in school,1
 m the close reason contains other criteia which are missing in the question,1
i have posted a new code with detailed explanations please tell me the difference between the two thank you everyone i hope this code will help you guys to understand what i am actually asking for,1
in my opinion  the real problem with this question,1

stackoverflow is not a design coding research or tutorial service",0
not that much difference show what youve tried or what youve looked at with as much detail as possible right now it just sounds like you want someone to do the work for you,0
how about you figure out the minimal amount of code that will demonstrate your issue and post that see how to create a minimal complete and verifiable examplehttpsstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,0
deleting lines arbitrarily to make your code shorter is not the way to create a mcve asking a question properly takes a reasonable amount of effort not a quick fix,0
yeah dont ask nonprogramming questions on stackoverflow,0
i smell a xy problemhttpxyprobleminfo whats your actual issue,0
did you even make an attempt to find a solution before coming here google has over a million hits on how to do this,0
flagged for too broad there are too many factors also this type of question does not belong on so,0

if you read the error message on the screen and google it you probably could have found the answer yourself,0
you didnt ask a question,0
so isnt a codewriting service wheres your implementation and whats the problem with it,0
thats just your requirement again we are not here to do your homework for you,0

this solution is simple readable and obvious,0
try to do some research before posting this is really a basic question,0
"this is a relatively basic question but the reason im downvoting it is because you have not provided enough information for anyone to give you an answer

to make the question appropriate you should at the least describe or provide the structure of the tables you want to query  in addition you may want to specify if you are querying using sql linq or some other accessor",0

downvoting because this answer is misleading described features of arraylist are found in the list too,0
hahah  i have problem what is answer,0
please consider searching the stackoverflow threads and other mediums before posting a question additionally make sure you post a question showing what you have tried,0
you mean like google,0
what do you want to know you have a method signature and an example call there is nothing more to be said about the code you posted,0
why am i garnering minuses on my question is it because people dont know the answer and want to take it out on the asker,0
codeinchaos how would you use this how is it useful how is it a method signature im used to seeing like public int testint a string b if it were like that it would make more sense,0
  and boltclock yes it is c if i put it into a solution it doesnt yell at me and even provides intellisense for the test method if indeed that is what it is as for compiling it nothing seems to happen it doesnt yell at me at the very least,0
that doesnt look like real sourcecode i cant think of a context where these two lines would compile if you claim that it compiles please post a compilable sample its just the method signature with an omitted body since documentation usually doesnt contain the method body,0
is this the full code sample,0
please post the link to the original doxygen example,0
not even the version you posted now compiles you cant have a method with no body inside a class,0
i ran it in vs2010 runs and compiles but does nothing,0
  doesnt compile for me,0
is this homework if not this is a remarkably bad method to do this operation,0
also if working fine means that the binary equivalent of 0xff is 1515 somethings wrong with my math skills,0

  9 out of ten persons who know c and qt if you tell them words signalslot will immediately associate this with typical qt pattern one will not i feel sorry for you,0
  also there are persons who by reading tags c qt would immediately associate this question as a qt specific as ive said i feel sorry for you,0
how are you applying the expression please post your code also please clarify what you mean with but none of them seemed to work what exactly does not work what is the result you get d only matches a single digit 09 matches the whole string if it contains at least on digit it appears you want d,0
wellstay cool  jcrowder sorry if im not as good as you i failed  ok can i,0
this question should probably have the homework tag,0
  and all that vote down thank you for your down votes now i cant ask more questionsi dont understand why you think this question will not help future visitors i tryed to find the answer to my problem and couldnt find any so here it is if someone have the same problem in the future here is the answer the knowledge is so vast that no one knows everything and sometimes its the little things we do not know that make all the difference,0
formatting your code and data sure makes a difference we put effort into our answers for you please put some effort into your questions for us,0
please have a look at the faqhttpstackoverflowcomfaq on how to ask a good question and also maybe read this what have you triedhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
yes there is a way but youll need to show your actual html and javascript that youre trying to do this with were not going to write it for you,0
can you show us how did you assign the id to your tag,0
this question shows a huge lack of effort both in researching and phrasing without actual code,0
you have to be more specific how do you want to send it do you have an established connection with the server what protocol can it be socet or has to webservice,0
i hope you arent making something sneaky  like a virus,0
1 since no efforts made to search answer,0
what fiddle where exactly is the problem,0
still looking for possible description or even solution to this cause i do need that clean file hierarchy by pip but with setuppy way,0
  in what way is this incorrect just because pip expects a setuppy it does not mean that pip does not provide any other behaviour,0
dude you answer is just plain wrong and downvoting my answer wont change that,0
  how is my answer wrong the reason op does not get exactly the same behaviour from setuppy as from pip is because they are not the same programme nor are they supposed to be whether or not he could use some combination of switches to achieve that is irrelevant,0
  are you trolling,0
  are you im answering the question that was asked,0
  that still does not make my answer misleading as you so charmingly put it,0
  by strict literalism yes you have correctly answered the question but the details are relevant its pretty clear that the op wants some understanding of why they behave differently or a way to modify the behaviour of one its like answering why do i perceive red differently from blue with because theyre different colours correct but useless,0
  where would we be if we constantly asked trivial questions different things are different if op wants to know about the implementation he is free to look at the source,0
  youre trolling arent you,0
  certainly not are you trolling you are the one who is defending a question that amounts to why are two distinct things not the same,0
  in neither case does the mechanism answer the why question it amounts to a restatement of the fact that the programmeeye works in a particular way you are essentially complaining that i didnt make up a question that like more and choose to answer that,0
  the very fact that you identify three possible topics shows that all that can be provided is general information of some kind so is not about making up your own better question and answering it,0
  so is not about providing unhelpful overlyliteral answers to provide useful information we often have to infer a better question the vote counts on these answers suggest other users think that providing some useful information is better than a literal but unhelpful answer,0
  bzzzt thats an ad hominem thanks for playing,0
  i dont have to there are plenty of comments already fyi ive also flagged that for moderator attention as not an answer you keep using so answers to boost your ego wo any benefit to the community you will get downvoted,0

what have you tried are you getting errors do you have some code you can show please give examples of your array of words and your input string how it starts and what it should look like at the end,0
how big is your dataset that you need the fastest way to do it,0
we cant help you if you dont show what youve tried so far and what specific problems youre having,0
yes it is possible what have you tried google is your friend,0
people will only put effort into responses if you put effort into your question requests to write code your code will probably be ignored requests for help in a specific area or a specific sample would have a better chance of response,0
  considering his rep i think he just has not had his morning coffee yet,0
  oh dont judge people by their rep considering the code he have not a slightest idea what does his code do,0
this question isnt particularly well phrased  it took the comments on the answers to actually work out whats really being asked,0
i strongly suspect youve misdiagnosed the issue please show a short but complete program demonstrating the problem,0
your code the one you haven’t posted is almost comically wrong this is why it’s important that you post all the relevant code questions like this just waste everybody’s time,0
  i wonder how you can judge that is comical if you havent seen it if you dont know the answer to the question how to prevent optimization on a class field in c please feel free to not waste your time with it,0
what have you tried so farhttpmattgemmellcom20081208whathaveyoutried,0
facepalm its help with the code im asking for i have not written any code yet with this omg,0
very basic stuff 1 second google httpphpnetmanualenreservedvariablespostphp,0
what exactly are you asking,0
  then next time dont tag java,0
did you just list every language you know,0
if you want a generic solution theres an language agnostic tag you should be using,0
not just code explain what youre trying to do in code next the problem,0
i dont know what you are doing with your edits here you have added a huge block of code and other information twice once before it got reopened and then you removed it and added it back recently,0
   see the discussion here httpmetastackexchangecomquestions189591issosprogrammerssiteabetterplaceforadvancedquestions189595189595,0

did you try looking for loop javascrip or javascript interval  do it,0
come one whats the code youve attempted,0
good luck getting one  i would expect these to be totally identical,0
a logical explanation of what exactly why theyre nearly identical because theyre essentially the same comparison,0
this is horrible advice  and only artificially extends how many more fragments you can pack in  this problem still remains google explicitly states not to use this to address memory leaks,0

please provide what you have tried so far,0
 is an unary operator socalled not do googling about c operators unarybitwise ones,0
yea wwwgooglecom,0
do some research before posting quest here,0
what help do you want and what have you tried,0
so what have you tried,0
and you want we create your code,0
no effort shown  no database mentioned,0
you could have easily got the answer by a simple google search  check this  httpwwww3schoolscomsqlsqltopasp,0
questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved include attempted solutions why they didnt work and the expected results,0
is that a question,0
lucky im not a compiler,0
you dont need to write the type down but if you cant figure it out on your own that just means you dont actually know what your program does,0
this code does not do any validation,0
thats the answer i gave 3 hours ago when you asked,0
still shouldnt be used at it looks horrible and devs maintaining your markup in the future will think its okay to reuse if youve used it  and they may not style out its inherent ugliness in practice its to be avoided,0
personally id avoid the thickness as it looks chunky,0
upvote means this question shows research effort it is useful and clear and at least 5 people on stackoverflow think this question meets that criteria,0
wait what you want me to help you steal a bunch of usernames and passwords,0
this isnt a place to have your script written for you search for perl open on how to open and read your file youll probably need some regexes to figure out whats a heading and whats a variable,0
why on earth are you doing three different queries to get data from your members table  youre selecting a field you already have in the first query some not necessarily related users encrypted password in the next query and then youre selecting every single userid in your members table,0
  its not really just a php thing its a working with relational databases thing and sort of a basic logic thing too  write out what you want your code to do verify that it makes sense and youre not adding a bunch of extra steps then write the actual code,0
what did you try,0
how is this parallel at all thats totally sequential i dont know why op accepted this as an answer,0
i dont see any question neither any description of what youve tried so far voting to close the question as not a real question,0
so is not your blog what does it mean to learn jquery before javascript that makes no sense,0
non sequitur  thanks,0
i think jquery is far more than just a javascript library no its just a library,0
we aint doing your homework for you show us your code explain what problem youre encountering and then we can help you,0
this answer doesnt absolutely reflect the point of question the asker wants no view controller,0
  i believe i already did globals are bad and what you have in your code are fancy globals i suggest you watch the videos in tereskos answer,0
just in case anyone reading this answer in the future thinks it is correct it is not mattmcdonalds answer is leaps and bounds better than this also never listen to w3schools they do not know what they are talking about and will misguide you,0
there are c to vbnet converters on the internet that can give you a big head start on a lot of this stuff,0
ok so youve told us the query and that you need help  neither of those things are questions whats the question what part are you having trouble with,0
welcome to so what have you tried please show you nonworking code and specify what is the current output and what is your desired output,0
have you considered hiring and paying a programmer,0
i am speechless,0

do your homework

have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question sharing your research helps everyone tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs this demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself it saves us from reiterating obvious answers and most of all it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer

i want a spaceship but seriously this question is lacking effort and understanding where is your code what have you tried,0
no detail on what you want to achieve no clear direction you havent even tried to ask the right question,0
probably because your question is short shows no demonstration of effort and seems to purposely discount the usual solutions that might be the best or only possibilities,0
probably because your question is way too broad and you have not posted the code you currently have so is not a do my homework site,0
in all seriousness just google search for css starfield and see what you get,0
did you study about time complexity calculation before asking the question,0
please perform rudimentary research on questions before posting to stackoverflow this question could be answered immediately using google,0

if this is indeed a homework question i suggest you find another college where they ask meaningful questions,0
let me guess you copied the above code from some site but it doesnt do exactly what you need so you want someone to fix it for you,0
while the question is more or less straightforward and the answer provided so far is correct this indeed looks like a copypasta for a homework assignment left to the last minute i find it hard to believe one could have written the code provided and not know how to fix the above problem,0
  ya ma niggah finding easy way out niggah,0
  this isnt a discussion forum its a qa site ask an ontopic questionhttpstackoverflowcomhelpontopic,0
  1 thats not a question both because its a comment and doesnt actually contain a specific question 2 we dont do urgenthttpmetastackexchangecomq6506 3 we dont do explanationhttpmetastackoverflowcomq2538943001761 learn how this site works or leave,0
and how to load jquery in google didnt help,0
theres a new startup company called google that can actually search the interwebs for you and give you an answer to thisit isnt a very big or well known company but give them a shot,0
have you not attended a single class yet isnt this something thats covered you know in the class materials,0
im pretty sure that is covered by the msdn documentation,0
i smell homework,0
dont feel this question is too broad as it is asking what is generics in c a simple googling like angle brackets in c could have lead   to a yummy answer like in this link httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarysbh15dyaaspx,0
you should read a beginners programming book first it seems like you do not understand the very basics of object oriented programming or any programming for that matter,0
so is not a code writing service at the very least show us your html and what jquery you have tried so far,0
this post shows no effort whatsoever in finding solution to your problem,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is about a typo and it serves no use beyond this single situation,0
the question is not clear the value of x is unknown no information about the error is given how do you expect us to help you,0
no i mean your question is irrelevant  your problem is wrong filename or wrong filename visible in windows what is your problem is filename ok,0
you meant to post this on your blog stack overflow is for questions,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is insane,0
  please use google for that mysql table limit rows,0
  there is a point for that  google something about partitioning and sharding but it is a rocket science,0
youre asking about general database scaling your questions range from entrylevel to seniordba level which is causing a lot of frustrating here youre not going to learn 5 years of experience in one questionanswer environment youve pointed out a lot of information that youve pieced together from the internet but its clear you dont understand all the implications start slow and work your way from there dont ask ridiculous questions and learn when youre out of your league thats the best thing you can take away from this question,0
google is your friend  how to open a url in a new window,0
why dont you come back when youve done some research and can show us some code,0
1 there are solutions all over google and theres a duplicate right here httpstackoverflowcomquestions726761javascriptopeninanewwindownottabrq1,0
possible duplicate of open a new window inside same page in a small sizehttpstackoverflowcomquestions9498621openanewwindowinsidesamepageinasmallsize,0
swing does not support sleep  but it does allow for swing timers which is just as good if not better  nor does it allow you to parse ints in an event listener when the references come from an array  sorry but this is hogwash youve got a bug in your code if you need our help post the code and lets help you find your bug or you can rant your choice,0
ive tried to clean up the formatting now what the op must do is to debug the parse errors  to look and see exactly what each array item holds if it has an trailing or leading spaces punctuation or anything else that needs to be trimmed   you definitely have a bug in your code the parsing issue has nothing to do with swing and your posted code is helpful next time please follow our advice youve wasted at lot of time and our patience remember please that we are all volunteers,0
please tell me those are dummy names,0
rip naming conventions,0
so isnt a codewriting service could you demonstrate that youve at least tried something,0
try writing it yourself and folks here will be glad to help if you get stuck,0
  whats the point of giving an answer two an unclear question and then complaining about comments making exactly the assumptions you made for your “answer”,0
we still do not know the definition of man,0
you were hired as a web programmer at a company and you cant create a simple form with serverside code to send an email to a predefined address,0
i highly doubt your question is a good fit for this website please consult httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask being polite also helps,0
what have you researched yourself what exactly dont you understand as this is a fairly beginnerlevel question i assume youre learning from a good bookhttpstackoverflowcomq3882421782465 or tutorial how was it explained there and what parts of that explanation are unclear,0
by searching and remember the jvm doesnt know what vowel means youll have to write the algorithm yourself,0
at least try i can think of a million ways to do this,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because the question is overly broad and shows no evidence of prior effort,0
i like this kind of questions asap what you are willing to pay us,0
what have you tried so far stackoverflow is not for finding people to do your work but to help if youre stuck,0
it was a trivial question perhaps you can all go downvote this one too which has far less effort shown httpstackoverflowcomquestions1948152selectlast5elementswithjquery ,0
why would you post a response when youre not familiar with the topic,0
  why would you post a comment that isnt helpful at all to the question 15 years later,0
you are paroniac dude so far i have never downvoted anybody not just for this question,0
there are umptillion tutorials on the web that explain how css selectors work 1,0
like others would say rtfm  at least bother to lecture the basics before asking on so,0
  table returns more than 200 rows debugging for values for each row is almost impossible,0
debug 200 rows is almost impossible  almost as hard as formatting a question,0
you are totally wrong sorry,0
honestly the op does not demonstrate any effort to solve the questions on his own usually it is expected to introduce the problem in a clear and concise manner check and highlight the difficulties that have prevented from solving the problem himself not check,0
no body will answer this nor will iyou should start readingfor your reference httpideonecomq7zsme,0
please dont be so ridiculous with your edits it seems this question was mostly downvoted because of an unnecessary edit chain just leave it now will you,0
help with what youve only introduced your problem its like saying im maroun please help,0
google it you can find alot in stack overflow,0
this question appears to be offtopic because it is about violating the tos of a third party site,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because this question is about violating the tos of a third party site,0
i am dead serious  you are saying that the code doesnt look right  so im asking what causes your suspicions  the code is syntactically correct although totally useless,0
this question is not what stackoverflow is for you should ask something that would help you not something about simple syntax how could anyone except php creator answer that if its correct  its correct,0
you have totally useless stuff with a right syntax the point that it does not make sense to you is right but you did not write a code to make sense for the computers  compiler i bet if they had an option to compile you  they would have thrown a null pointer exception on your brain,0
does swift have no documentation,0
alright easy now everybody i think 13 is more than sufficient,0
  i certainly wouldnt do it in production  for a dev box what does it matter its the easiest path to a reasonable facsimile of production,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because a simple attempt to run the code would have yielded the result,0
but you can try it for yourself observe the result and ask a question if the result is different  at which point your question can include the actual result alongside the reasoning for your expectation hint try reading the documentation for integerparseintstring first,0
  a word of warning  if you intend to become a professional programmer you are going to have to learn to look up documentation and to run programs if you want to know what happens when you run them your mother is not always going to be on hand to spoonfeed you your breakfast,0
no minimal research is done here,0
assuming this is homework namespace 1128 please show real effort and dont simply post the assignment i cant imagine what else the point of this assignment would be except to answer the question youre asking us,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because it does not appear to be asking about programming as defined by the help centerhttpstackoverflowcomhelp,0
this is a bad bad answer ,0
that first link is really a terrible terrible introduction to how to generate a normal distribution just awful and wrong please dont give it additional traffic by linking it,0
no  gaussian  randomnumber  sigma  median  this is completely wrong  unless randomnumber is gaussiannormal to start with,0
  please remove that gaussianrandomnumbersigmamedian equation it is hurting my eyes,0
why is this the accepted answer its factually wrong,0
this really stinks for    a few downvotes is not a big deal but because his incorrect answer was selected as the right answer his rep is taking a huge beating,0
and the documentation was no help here i rarely berate people for not googling but this would have been solved in 2 seconds by typing your title into a search engine,0
"  pieters removed comment 
my point was google it before you post here it takes me a great deal of effort and research before i post a question and id hope that others at least try to some extent",0
  absolutely and thats why this question is getting downvoted this much a quick google for perl time gave me the same info that ysth posted the op may need to pick up some more research skills first,0
oh man this is cleaner than anything i can think of  just hope some random copypaster from the interwebz doesnt shoot this directly into their console without looking at it ,0
study your math first then java,0
this is more a html question and a very silly mistake,0
did you read the code at all,0
its 2014 we can do better than this ,0
i would delete this answer to avoid the shame haha,0
error messages exist for a reason,0
  give me the reason and the solution to solve this problem ill give you a downvote instead,0
  so youre trying to learn c on the fly at a coding event oo,0
  yo welcome and never ask such type of silly questions its only making a junk in so,0
why dont you test yourself,0
try 10 as answer,0
this is not a site where we do your homework,0
consider taking a look at httpstackoverflowcomtour to learn how so works,0
whats wrong with that code you have there  its correct  that error you have provided is nonsense,0
  i rolled back you last change it invalidated the answer and your new question was only visible in the comment of the edit please accept the answer you received as it solved the problem you asked about if you have a new question ask a new question  not edit this one and maybe also learn how to ask good questions by reducing your code to an mcvehttpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,0
easy ton find on google ,0
you should really learn googleing and reading apis,0
we dont like screenshots without seeing how you created templist and on its hard to say whats wrong,0
i dont use classes or sprites or line breaks,0
  what exactly not working  post only the relevant part ,0
this hurts my eyes,0
too much code break it down,0
so many magic numbers,0
why even use java go straight to machine code,0
and the precision problems mentioned means that you cant use them as indexes the reasons really are endless you should dig into some computer history,0
really i mean by the time you wrote the question you could have done the calculation using your fingers,0
its funny how much attention this question is attracting,0
there are so many possibilties why not just use google or bing or whatever at first ,0
questions asking us to recommend or find a book tool software library tutorial or other offsite resource are offtopic for stack overflow,0
have you tried anything yet,0
dont bother it will be 76,0
this is not java,0
i hope you didnt write is less than,0
really none other than the ability to handle unicode in any encoding other than utf8 with all the performance issues with certain string operations that utf8 has or the fact that any desyncronisation between your string and your helper variable can lead to security issues,0
this answer is so wrong it makes me angry buffer overflows and encrypted data if nothing else,0
yes its a pithy and flippant answer that someone with nearly 60k reputation should know is unhelpful,0
the errors are quite selfexplanatory also please learn how to indent the code it will help a lot in the future,0
one think i am clear that your name is amol and no you havent spent two days for this problem,0
  you should try to find the solution yourself first this specific error is not rare especially when generated by the problem you have and if you rely on other people to tell you every time what to do its gonna be a long ride,0
  no this question is different it is still a bad question but different,0
in addition you might want to take a look at should hi thanks taglines and salutations be removed from postshttpmetastackexchangecomquestions2950shouldhithankstaglinesandsalutationsberemovedfromposts,0
what just execute your code in the else block,0
first of all fix your horrible formatting,0
sounds like a good question for your classmates or instructor your class is also a resource dont ignore it,0
this question has been asked many times before and you can find qhat you are looking for here there is no need to ask this question again,0
your code is unreadable bro,0
where did you get this code seems very strange code,0
from where you bring this code ,0
so is not a code writing service please show what you have tried and explain in what ways it does not work,0
this should be better,0
welcome to stack overflow you seem to be asking for someone to write some code for you stack overflow is a question and answer site not a codewriting service please see herehttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask to learn how to write effective questions,0
  dafuq really that doesnt make sense ,0
this is an incredibly bad researched question did you check the reference documentationhttpencppreferencecomwcppiocfprintf already what didnt you get from there,0
wouldnt a simple google search reveal this downvoting you can refer how to ask a question by checking httpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask and how to create an example by reading this  httpstackoverflowcomhelpmcve,0
  if you have not found on google that you can not create constructors outside a class you either didnt google at all or should really update both your knowledge of java and of howtogoogle,0
  this is not wrong  please read the question first  there is no reference to phone call,0
these are very basic rskills you will benefit a lot if you do some basic tutorials also taking some of your other questions into account in which you also have difficulties in very basic r operations,0
im voting to close this question as offtopic because it appears to be too simple,0
did you thought through the code and algorithm,0
so is not a site for crowdsourcing your homework and i would like help is not a programming question,0
it this that homework again,0
go back and look at your notes read through your textbook and start working on it later if you have a specific question about something come back and ask and people will be a lot more willing to help you were not gonna do your homework for you,0
hi id strongly suggest that you had a look at the tourhttpstackoverflowcomtour to get a better idea of how so works so is not a teaching portal,0
this can easily be researched online question is far too broad as it stands for so,0
this is so well documented why are you fishing for reputation when you have so much already,0
come on you only need to try and compile that to know its not going to work,0
cant close this question as duplicate that is really poor,0
this is why i love stackoverflow my wife sometimes look at me awkwardly when i laugh while looking at code,0
what kind of sorcery is this please read how to askhttpstackoverflowcomhelphowtoask page before asking any questions in the future please,0
who please dont come with question like that which will not serve to future user or current community,0
completely wrong,0
this is nonsense,0
does not work is not a technical term if you want to be a developer explain the problem in detail,0
next time post the real method instead of making it up from memory,0
pure codewriting requests are offtopic on stack overflow  we expect questions here to relate to specific programming problems  but we will happily help you write it yourself tell us what youve triedhttpwhathaveyoutriedcom and where you are stuck this will also help us answer your question better,0
  how about closing it as a dupe find all occurrences of a substring in pythonhttpstackoverflowcomq4664850 i will wait to hammer till i get your approval,0
you could have at least bothered to enter image description here as suggested,0
its something that you will find explained in every good c book,0
the question wasnt related in any way to this response this is a problem with kotlin as a language not kotlin on android and i think this is just sarcasm imho,0
  nevertheless posting his own answer after first trying to delete the question after taking advantange of diegos time makes him in4001 a bad actor,0
downvote reason so is not a write my code for me kind of website you should show your efforts,0
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

lol seriously",0
  this is a qa site not a qa site besideshttpblogstackoverflowcom201107itsoktoaskandansweryourownquestions,0
  theres nothing forbidden about answering your own questions although its not like this question has a lot of value its basic java syntax and people should have learned this during the first week of programming however it seems that a lot of the people dont bother reading the basic tutorials resulting in ridiculous questions,0
plus 1 for honestystraight as an arrow  havent tried anything,0
so its the second character now you could have mentioned that,0
  so whats the solution for that then,0
no it wont work,0
doesnt seem related to the question though,0
this has to be the weirdest answer i have ever seen,0
this is so basic i have to assume you did no research and made no effort to solve this yourself,0
  you seem be convinced that you know better than everyone out here then why are you asking no the result of s1concatdef wont go into the string pool and i cant understand what youre asking me,0
you did not receive attention because this question is totally opinion based as always every dev will call out for hisher favorite framework and you would have no more information at the end they can all do it but all requires a different level of expertise my suggestion would be  if you have expertise in any of those already go for it or try to get some expertise in the other and make the choice yourself based on what you can get from the different framework,0
this does not make any sense why would you want to convert an integer into a class they are two completely different types i propose you read about oo first,0
  you should consider changing your internship workplace,0
google for file io using c,0
i suggest studying c and then asking here this is way too basic and can be covered by any decent c book for beginners,0
your program wont even print anything until it has finished  almost forever and since you didnt initialise mpf it could print junk,0
rather that complaining about being required to write some text why not put some effort into writing a good question for example tell us what is project euler prob 3,0
 is usually called a colon not a double comma ive never heard it called anything but a colon but i dont know whether there are any regional differences ,0
theoretically it could be just as fast file a bug report to your cc compiler vendor please dont im being sarcastic,0
the question is a bit like asking why it takes longer to get your car out of the garage and drive to the corner shop than it does to walk,0
so how do you compile this nonsense c or c please first read about proper benchmarking there is more to doing it correctly than taking the time to loadexecuteterminate it,0
  i find this question quite terrible and the fact that you can write a nice bit of text doesnt redeem the question if you set me off on the right topic i might not need much prodding to rave on about it but that doesnt make the question any less lazy and misguided,0
  i guess i dont see it as much worse than some of the other dumb questions that get upvotes and involve serious misconceptions  i wish this had never been asked at all instead of being asked and then getting a notveryaccurate answer that misses the main reason for the observed behaviour  although the accepted answer does at least correct the misunderstanding that c is 2x slower than asm  inaccurate answers make me crazy,0
what else would you expect to happen if you do something twice it gets done twice,0
this function did exactly what i told it to do why did it do that basically,0
  as it looks right now any book would do well,0
outch a needless switch statement only to have it,0
probably trying to cheat his way through an interview test,0
using uppercase is considered screaming thus rude and impolite you are disrespecting this community you see this is not a place where you drop your requirements and other people do the thinking for your,0
delete this ans,0
this really looks like some lastminute panic on your homework,0
you say you cant use group by because your instructor said so but that youre doing this exercise for your own practice how does that work,0
what are you trying to do and why would you want to do it this way  this is not cleaver coding clever coding is doing the minimum possible to achieve the result in this case cout   2  4    24 would  work  maybe you could look at templates they might suit your needs better,0
i did get a good chuckle out of this answer,0
well it is correct in the wrong way,0
damn dont work as admin if you dont need to,0
wtf is this how do you end up in your system32 folder,0
this ones by far the most downvoted answer i have seen  lollol,0
this is a god like answer  he is far further along than any of us in terms of programming  none of us can understand,0
because it doesnt support it its like asking why an automobile cant fly also your example usage is nonsense,0
looks like you are trying to hack something,0
before adding a bounty to your question at least go through the motion of making it a real question no one has any real idea as to what youre actually after my intuition is that this is an xy problemhttpmetastackexchangecomquestions66377whatisthexyproblem please clean up your question see to the help centerhttpstackoverflowcomhelp for further reference,0
this definitely smacks of an xy question could the poster provide any type of background about why the artificial constraints hes imposed are practical in some way,0
why does the output include apple and not include mango  why does the output not include the new first column  where did the 0 in the example output come from  why is a row with 456 chosen when neither such row contains purchased  in other words your desired output doesnt bear any obvious relation to the conditions specified in the question or the sample input data,0
 sorry the desired output was correct but i was wrong with the run command which i have changed now the nulls are replaced as zero let me know if you can help me now ,0
within a selection  what selection a range in a worksheet that has the worksheet names the selected worksheets what do you mean by that also what have you tried  so is not a code writing service let us know what youve tried what failed any error messages etc and we can help you we dont tend to write from scratch,0
  many have come here to help we cannot do such with the information given there are too many possible answers  brucewayne and matthewd are two of the best at doing this  when they asked question to clarify your question you assumed you knew more  your assumptions about us are such a generalization that it begs the question why we would ever help  many of us work in the it and many others do not  we are a large community that i am sure include ceos to street sweepers  we do this not for the glory but to help  your attitude is uncalled for,0
heres how you select a worksheet worksheetssheetnameselect if its in a range for each cel in rng worksheetscelvalueselect next cel except i have a feeling thats not what you want if you cant be helpful for us we cant help you you say youve looked thoroughly  where have you looked this kind of thing is something that is used all the time and you should be able to find ample resources  can you please post in your op what youve tried how it worked differently from what you expect and please expand on what you mean by selecting a worksheet in a range,0
learning c from videos seems to be error prone well i never tried so being educating myself old school ways from books and practising but your track seems to be a weak one,0
there is no way that you couldnt find the answer to this by google searching,0
people think you didnt google hard enough,0
the downvotes are mainly because you didnt read google or even bother to provide in the question the error message,0
youve got 72 rep points  and so surely you know how to post well formatted code by now right you also know that if code is well formatted it is more easily understood right,0
the scope of any exam is to test your knowledge of the topic asking an urgent or lastminute question on so defiles that scope plus your question isnt fit for so anyway for many reasons see herehttpstackoverflowcomhelp,0
this is going to be a gone case,0
i would like an advancement payable to me asap if i answer this simple question for you what have you actually done and or tried also please read the following how to ask a questionhttpstackoverflowcomquestionsask,0
this does not make any sense what are you  trying to achieve,0
   apparently it does not make any sense to a few other people as well,0
nay alas you have to solve your homework on your own we all had to go through that ,0
share your code and we can help you with some guidelines nobody here will do the homework for you,0
its sort of an if you have to ask youre not yet ready to know question but basiles answer has some splendid arrows in the right direction to me the real question is not so much why you thought basic types and keywords were defined anywhere but specifically why you in stdioh,0
does that question indeed poorly asked deserve so many downvotes,0
hint if you tell people not to downvote the question lots of them will do exactly that plz do not downvote is a cue that the question probably needs to be downvoted either way that is just noise that does not belong in a question i have edited it out here and otherwise improved the clarity of your question please do not add it back in there is nothing you can do about how people decide to vote if the question is useful and clear you will generally get more upvotes than downvotes which makes up for it in the end complaining about it in the comments is also discouraged,0
questions asking us to recommend or find a book tool software library tutorial or other offsite resource are offtopic for stack overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam instead describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it,0
please take the tour and visit ask as well as the checklisthttpmetastackoverflowcomquestions260648stackoverflowquestionchecklist your question isnt particular well asked and deserves a better title after that i guess it is also a duplicate,0
you should go back some lessons and learn the meaning of main and executables your code contains nothing but implementations of how to do something but actually does nothing,0
  see all the functions you wrote none of them are ever being executed because youre not calling them anywhere,0
yeah there is something off about this question,0
i did go and read the whole thing like you said and indeed i wept but mainly at the stupidity of felix which i dont think was what you were trying to get across,0
you seem very resolute on your stance concerning the standard being broken may i ask if you have a defect report on the way,0
  its integer overflow it happens obviously it is wrong for the compiler to assume that it doesnt its that assumption which is wrong not the fact that the call removed was an assert it should not be ub at all it should be defined to either wrap 2scompliment or trap and those are the only sensible things for a compiler to do assuming it cant happen in 2015 when all know it is a major source of security bugs is not innocent nor even stupid its malice,0
anybody who is pitying safety versus performance should just switch to java,0
downvoted for the useless rant they are  introducing bugs on purpose perhaps for a foreign government really this isnt rconspiracy,0
  you have to stop thinking these things are accidents havent you been paying attention two  thats two  unknown parties subverted juniperos we kind of assume one was the nsa but who was the other,0
decent programmers over and over again repeat the mantra do not invoke undefined behaviour yet these nonks have gone ahead and done it anyway and look what happened i have no sympathy whatsoever this is the developers fault simple as that they need to take responsibility remember that personal responsibility people relying on your mantra but what about in practice is precisely how this situation arose in the first place avoiding nonsense like this is precisely why standards exist in the first place code to standards and you wont have a problem period,0
they dont read the compiler release notes they assume the compiler writer is on their side and if they work for me they are subsequently fired for gross incompetence seriously who calls themselves a programmer yet doesnt bother to read release notes when they upgrade their entire toolchain to a new major revision defending that behaviour with the ridiculous the standard is wrong is just absurd is the c standard perfect absofrickinglutely not but its right in this case and even if it werent your rationale is mortifyingly flawed,0
  im amazed nobody stepped in to tell felix to calm down what a douche nine years on i wonder where he is now,0
it goes against the c groupthink but this is the only correct answer to this question  they just dont care about whether they break existing widelyused previouslyworking code and the c community is too broken to recognize that,0
with all due respect i would put money on the bug being with your code and not the compiler,0
your program seems to have a split personality disorder it cant decide whether its c or c,0
  be as harsh as you want but my point still stands  its much more likely for a problem to be with your own code than with the compiler and its a mark of inexperience to assume the opposite,0
  dont ge me wrong i am definitely not saying the problem is from the compiler then you should change your question title to something more meaningful also provide a mcve including a detailed description of the problem and what you did observe when stepping through your program code with the debugger after you did all that you probably solved your problem without asking here at all,0
asked thousand times google your title which you should have done before youve asked this,0
then you need to work on your googling skills  i feel like i see this question asked and closed as a dupe every other day,0
   yes and the answer is there are too many people who dont know how to research  once a question as simple to find as this has been asked once it should not be asked again,0
frustating is to see people who dont care to invest a minimum effort on research,0
googled first buddy,0
in general we want you to post a selfcontained question  giving us the link to buy the book on amazon really doesnt cover the required background  i expect that youre not allowed to post the applicable material from the book as a result this question wont be appropriate for stackexchange,0
probably this is referring to a different context than the one you think it refers to wtf alex,0
this site is not for interview us,0
i guess im committing some capital sin here can anyone please explain which,0
your question is so vague and open ended that youd have attracted close votes but a question with a bounty cant be closed so you get downvotes instead,0
youre essentially asking stackoverflow users to write code for your specific use case on their own time if you cant figure out those academic papers hire someone who can,0
you dont provide much enough information in my opinion my first thought was convolution but if it doesnt need to be that precise then just a simple high pass filter to find the words and gaps may be adequate the negativity may be that it isnt a programming question co much as a signal analysis question and by making it a programming question it comes across as write my code,0
also so is not a forum,0
hey girl with pearl earring  you could possibly ask a question like this on the gamedevcom site where general techniques can be discussed  quite simply this site is for asking about specific bugs in code this site has nothing to do with general technique discussion  so find the better site to ask your question on,0
this is insane,0
somebody had a bad day  its true there are many situations where bypassing certificate validation is useful,0
wrt if i ever notice that that question has been reopened then i will delete this copy and reproduce my answer there what are you going to do if the answer you should end up accepting isnt yours,0
  i dont see a problem what are you imagining,0
  someone posts a bright shining solution to this question the old question gets reopened so you copy your solution into the old question and delete this question and said bright shining solution to the original question is gone from posterity i didnt downvote this btw,0
  i dont follow is this a complaint about me chasing points i have updated the original question to improve the english but i still cant post a solution there that doesnt seem to be how so wants to work there is also a commandline solution as well as my own win all round,0
