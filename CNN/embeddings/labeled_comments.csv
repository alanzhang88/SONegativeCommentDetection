"[PPCG has a good definition of quines](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4877/what-counts-as-a-proper-quine).`repr()` does _not_ use reflection. It is a standard function that takes string inputs and outputs other strings. An example would be does `repr(input())` read the source at all? The string just happens to include part of the source, as the source defines the string (As what else would when hard-coding a string?). And `%` on a string is just string formatting. Formatting is also a function that doesn't rely on the source, just the arguments (i.e. no side effects.)",1

And the logic is flawed, first `free()` individual arrays that are no longer needed (if any), then resize your array of pointers, then allocate newly needed individual arrays and resize those that were there before.
