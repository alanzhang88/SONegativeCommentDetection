Since there is nobody at the last spot, it cannot be mapped, which gives [2, 1, 1, 0]. No matter how many times the people follow this set of dance moves, the first three places remain occupied.

"@Brad So syntatically am I looking at something along the lines of a for loop that goes **(int i = 0; i < size; i++) { if (sport_type[index] == 'insert char here') {print out message} }** with size being a counter variable that I set in main to increment each time a new reservation, and thus an indices of the array is set?",1
You have it. Recommend generalizing the function a bit and passing in `'insert char here'` and a string containing a longer description of the sport as parameters. That way you only have to write one function for all sports.,1
...and don't forget to post the final code here so that others can find it in the future.,1
Compiler warnings sometimes need to be enabled. In Visual Studio open the properties and navigate Configuration Properties ->C/C++->General and play with the Warning Level. In GCC add a -Wall to the command line or play with the GUI of whatever IDE you're using to set the command line for you. You'll have to look that up yourself because there are dozens of them.,1
"And part three, in `input_reservation` the line `sport_type[index] = input_type(sport_type, index);` counts on `input_type` returning the correct value, so currently the code blows itself up by not returning. Ideologically, a function should do only one thing, so input should just take input and hand that input off to someone who knows how best to store it. The simpler a function is, the easier it is to debug. So `char input_type(char sport_type[], int index)` should probably be `char input_type()`, read the user input into a temporary value, test the value and return the value when it's good.",1
"@user4581301 I edited with my current revisions. My program is currently running as far as letting the user enter the desired reservation type and patron age, but is not printing anything when the user enters '2'. I will revise again with the changes you suggested about changing the functions",1

Then which time zone do you want to format in?,1
Neither. Timezone is unknown.,1
"Then `Date` isn't what you want, as that represents an *instant* in time, which only has a local year/month/day/hour/minute/second when you apply a time zone. The same instant has different values in different time zones, and they don't make sense without a time zone. It's like asking for the binary encoding of a string without specifying an encoding...",1
"@JonSkeet no, `Date` represents measure of time. It can mean one instant in one timezone and another instant in another.",1
"@JonSkeet no, it's like asking a distance without specifying an origin. We have `double` type which holds this. Nobody requires to provide units of measurement and origin for doubles. The same should be for date-time.",1
"@Dims: No, it really doesn't `Date` is an instant in time - a number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. It's not since some arbitrary point in time - it has a well-specified origin. The longer you fight against this, the longer you will have problems. *Please* accept it. If you don't believe me, you should read the `java.util.Date` documentation, which starts ""The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision.""",1
Your code is correct. You are also correct that it depends on your JVM's time zone and for the same `Date` object will produce differnt results in different time zones. Exactly therefore you need to specify for which time zone you want the result.,1
"If all you have is a point in absolute time (relative to UNIX timestamp), there is no way to format it without a time zone, because that will display as a different time in different time zones.  Where, and in what format, does your value come from?",1
@SLaks suppose it is in Shire,1
@JonSkeet what are you saying does imply UTC.,1
"@Dims: If you have a timezone, you can specify that timezone and you won't have a problem.",1
@SLaks I have no timezone. I have `HH:MM:SS` from third party source. It's timezone if unknown and may mean different instant than one I get if parse this string.,1
"@JonSkeet see my very simple example code, showing, that `Date` is not instant.",1
"@Slaks it not only format matter, you can also call `getHours()` getter and see the same. `Date()` is JUST NOT AN INSTANCE if you use it's components in any way. And you use it in numerous cases. For example, if you read `Date` from database server by clients all over the world, you will get the same components, but different `getTime()`.",1
"IOW, you _don't_ have an absolute time.  You want https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalTime.html",1
"Your tests don't show what you seem to think it shows. You're parsing it in the system default time zone, and constructing 1970-01-01T00:00:01 *in the system default time zone*. However, I'm done here. You're ignoring both what the documentation says and what someone with considerably experience in date/time work says. You're welcome to do that of course, but you're not going to make any progress. You should follow SLaks advice and use `LocalTime`, as that's what the value you're receiving represents. It doesn't represent an unambiguous instant in time.",1
@JonSkeet and you are ignoring how `Date` is used in numerous libraries and tools. I am done here too.,1
"@SLaks I don't want absolute time, I want relative time.",1
"Then you want `LocalTime` or `LocalDateTime`, as that's precisely what they model.",1
"A `Date` only contains an instant. Whether it contains a *correct* instance, well, if it contains an incorrect one it certainly wouldn’t be the first time. In you so-called(!) proof, it contains an instant of 2 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds before the epoch — which in turn tells me you JVM’s time zone is at an offset of 3 hours from UTC.",1
"Dims, I believe the real answer to your question is: stay away from `java.util.Date`. It confuses you, and there’s no reason why you should want that. Use the newer classes in `java.time` instead, like those @JonSkeet mentions.",1
"_I don't want absolute time, I want relative time._ I think what you are looking for is `Duration` or `Period` from `java.time`. Even so numerous libraries and tools use `Date` doesn't mean it's correct.",1
"@LukasWöhrl, that depends on relative to what. If relative to a time zone, Jon Skeet’s suggestion is better. If relative between two points in time, you are entirely correct.",1
"@LukasWöhrl I agree it is not correct, this is my point. And it is not ""an instant"", but it is dual. Second nature of `Date` appears not in formatting only, but in many cases.",1
"@OleV.V. absolutely, just wanted to throw those into the field, as they haven't mentioned yet. @ Dims This simply shows that time is a **very** complex field. Jon Skeet is an expert there, trust him.",1
"I agree in your view that the `Date` class was designed with a “second nature”. I just meant to say, the state a `Date` object holds is an instant only. The second nature is in constructors, the methods, particularly the many deprecated methods, but also in `toString()`. This design is generally considered poor in retrospect and is one of the reasons new classes were designed twice, first `Calendar` and later all the `java.time` classes.",1
@Dims Assume you have a `Date` object created by expression `new Date(60*1000)`. What is the expected String you want to generate from this?,1
"@OleV.V. according to OOP paradigm, the internals of object is black box; the ""true nature"" of object -- is what you can get from it or set to it by it's methods. You can't say, that some of methods are ""true"" and another methods are ""false"". The matter of fact is that `Date` class has TWO contracts, regardless the number of downvotes and regardless documentation. There are a lot of libraries, that READ datetime and present it in `Date` format for java. In this moment, the contract of ""number of milliseconds from UNIX era"" is violated.",1
@infiniteRefactor in my situation I am receiving date time from another source and it is constructed from parts. And I need to print exactly these parts. Your case is irrelevant.,1
"@Dims If the `Date` is constructed from, say, year, month, day in month, hrs and min and you cannot guess the time zone used when constructing it, there is no way you can fulfil the requirement of printing those parts from the `Date`.",1
"@Dims OK. Assume you have a `Date` object created by expression `new Date(70, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)`. What is the expected String you want to generate from this?",1
"@infiniteRefactor something like `1970-01-01 00:01:00` Order should depend on format, but components should be kept.",1
"@OleV.V. Please, understand, that timezone should not be part of date, because date should measure time, while timezone is a measure for space. We are not storing kilograms, meters, and so on units in double. And whe should not keep timezone in Date.",1
"Your ""Update 4"" only proves that `getHours()` reflects the local time zone, which you are changing.  If one repeatedly evaluates `a+b`, and gets different sums when changing `b`, that doesn't mean that `a` is also changing.",1
"@MattJohnson but this means that `a+b` contains also `b`, but not only `a`.",1
"""Contains"" is the wrong word, but sure, `a+b` *is dependent on* both `a` and `b`, in the same way that the hour returned from `getHours` is dependent on both the instant held by the `Date` object and the local time zone.  That does not mean that the instant changes when you change the time zone, no more than it means that `a` changes when you change `b`.",1
"Also, you say in the sample: ""hours property"".  However, `date.getHours()` is a method, not a property.  Java doesn't have properties in the same way that C# has. [It only has methods.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2963249/634824).  A method that takes as input some outside information cannot be described as [pure](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22395430/634824).  Therefore, what you are observing is simply that the `getHours` method is impure because it takes the system time zone as one of its inputs.",1
"@MattJohnson expression `a+b` namely CONTAINS `b`. You MAY say ""depends on"", but you can't say ""contains"" is wrong. 

I never said instant changes, I only said `Date` contains not only instant and this is true. Date is the same as `a+b` in your excellent example, where `a` is an instant and `b` is timezone.

In terms of Java bean convention, `getHours` is a property getter for property ""hours"". I may rewrite access to this property with any bean library. The fact that getters in Java do not have additional brace level changes nothing.

Of course you may say `getHours` is ""impure"".",1
"I believe that it is finally clear what the problem is here. If class `a` has a method `getData` and this `getData` method is returning `a` internal state (which is an instant) modified by some external value (let's skip the timezone, let's say it's user's screen resolution) does this make `a` an instant or not. And does this imply that `a` stores screen resolution or not.  I believe that this is simply semantics thing - how you define what is an instant? It seems that most people define instant differently from the question's author...",1
@PawelGradecki I understand instant as a point on time dimension. I don't deny `Date` contains instant. I deny it IS an instant. We may say it is IMPURE instant if you wish. The very fact that `Date` has so much depreated methods (and that there are so many alternative implementations) alone proves that `java.util.Date` is both impure and bad design.,1
"Ok I understand what you mean,  but can you refer to the example with screen resolution? If the class with a private instant field would have a `getData` method which would return value based on local screen resolution (or any other environmental data), would that mean that it is not instant? Just want to make sure that I get your instant definition right. I believe that a game changer here would be to provide a definition of an ""instant"" from some trustful source, because the discussion is about instants and nobody posted any definition yet.",1
"@PawelGradecki it depends on whether it is possible to reach instant pure. If the class would have only `getData()` which returns only instant, dirtied with screen resolution, I would say either it is not instant, or some special sort of instant, defined by class designer. I am opened to any definition, but it should not drift.",1

"Of course it runs infinitely. The contents of the loop keep checking the same variables, hoping that their values would somehow magically change, on their own. Of course, C++ doesn't work this way.

Have you tried stepping through the code using a debugger?,1
"`commandInput == ""invReport""` this is not how you compare two strings.",1
You `return` a value from `checkdata()`. That does ***not*** automatically `return` and abort the code in `changemode()`. You're not doing anything with the return value from `checkdata`. You're literally calling `checkdata` and then *unconditionally* call `gotothen`; each and every time.,1

"Haskell's type classes are not a form of object-orientation. They are a form of ad-hoc polymorphism, which you typically also get from object systems. But they do not couple data and methods, which is the hallmark of object-orientation.",1
@sclv They do in fact couple data and methods - the type of the data determines which function (or which part of the function definition if you want to view it that way) is called.,1
that couples the *type* of the data and methods! http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/OOP_vs_type_classes,1
"@sclv is right; Haskell typeclasses are much closer to OOP interfaces than OOP classes, but even that analogy isn't perfect. In fact, the closest thing to OOP classes in Haskell are simply [data types containing functions and monadic actions](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FAQ#I.27m_making_an_RPG._Should_I_define_a_type_for_each_kind_of_monster.2C_and_a_type_class_for_them.3F).",1
"@sclv Yes, and that is characteristic of object oriented languages. Only a minority associate operations with instances at all; in even fewer can that be described as the normal operation of the OO system.",1
"@sclv I dont think this is true (although it is an acceptable ""lie to children"").  If you dont think about the constraint system, typeclasses are just a slightly restricted object system.  In that typeclasses have 1. subtyping 2. implicit self reference 3. replaceable self reference (aka inheritance).  A typeclass is just a (parameterized) abstract class in oop while an instance is just an object that inherits from that abstract class.  With GHC 7.4 and some trickery involving `newtype`, `unsafeCoerce` and implicit parameters this correspondence becomes complete.",1
"I also think that ""couple data and methods"" is really independent from OO.  Consider Go as the example of a language where methods are separate from structs, yet it is very OOP.",1
"On the other hand, the naive view that typeclasses are equivalent to interfaces and that datatypes in Haskell are equivalent to classes in OOP that implement those interfaces is just wrong.  The typeclass system is a layer used for defining classes (in the mathematical sense, aka predicates) over Haskell types.  It just happens to be an Object Oriented layer to for defining predicates over Haskell types.",1
@PhilipJF My answer in no way relies on OO being able to do everything that Haskell type classes can do. It relies on the Haskell type class system being able to do everything that OO can.,1
"@PhilipJF Don't know why I'm responding to this nonsense, but typeclasses don't have subtyping, don't have implicit self reference, and don't have inheritance. The ""Haskell's Overlooked Object System"" paper has a good discussion of why typeclasses don't do the job (and hence what it proposes instead), and I think the O'Haskell paper also motivate the differences quite well. Anyway, implicit parameters are not idiomatic Haskell these days, and unlikely to make it into a standard, and once you start to involve unsafeCoerce then you're clearly off the reservation.",1
"@sclv I'm not sure what either of those papers have to do with my claim.  The class per class encoding is clumsy, I agree. My point is more subtle.  Typeclasses in Haskell are classes over types.  We are all constructivist here, so for us to suppose a type is a member of a typeclass requires some sort of ""evidence object"".  Further, the language provides an automatic theorem proving system in the form of inference and global instances.  My claim is only that the proof language for this logic is OO, and it is helpful for reasoning about Haskell to be aware of this fact.",1
"The ""evidence type"" for membership in `Ord` is a subtype of the evidence type for membership in `Eq`.  Implicit this references and inheritance are what let you declare `m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k"" in the definition of `Monad`.  To simulate this behavior with records requires finding a fix-point (as pointed out by Oleg), which should clue you in something is up.  The reason this shouldn't be surprising is that typeclasses sit on the other-side of the ""expresion problem"" from Abstract Data Types.  From William Cooks work we know that means they are probably objects.",1
"Obviously this object system is a restricted one, but you just need to look at Bruno Oliveira's work to know that is a non-essential aspect (see Scala's implicits).  My point about `unsafeCoerce` is that with some extensions and unsafe features you can actually get your hands on the Objects that bare witness to type-class membership  , and using implicit parameters you can construct arbitrary such instances at runtime (although it relies on the compiler not obeying its documentation).",1
"@PhilipJF the ""evidence type"" for membership in Ord (dictionary, I suppose you mean) isn't a subtype of the evidence type for membership in Eq. It's just that Ord membership implies Eq membership. An ord instance can't ""override"" Eq methods. I have no idea what you're getting at with the monad example -- yes if you encode monads with objects, then the encoding is object-y, but that's because you chose an object-y encoding to begin with! Anyway, this ""evidence type"" doesn't always exist. Other implementations of Haskell, such as JHC, show you can go very far without a dictionary encoding.",1
"@sclv A proof of membership in Ord is a proof of membership in Eq.  ""is a"" is the same thing as subtype.  The Monad example is about inheritance (not subtyping, they are separate) since unless a Monad instance overrides the default definition of `>>` it inherits a general one, but this general one uses `>>=` which is defined virtually.  This is what I was talking about in terms of ""implicit this parameter"" and inheritance.   The point that you dont have direct access to this object system and that it isn't always implemented directly, doesn't really matter.  It explains the semantics.",1
But you can explain the semantics *without* an object system too. Does the fact that I can explain counting with pebbles mean that naturals are a *kind* of collection of pebbles?,1
@sclv An object system is anything that meets certain criteria. You cannot say the same of a collection of pebbles.,1
"that is a good point.  I find that thinking about typeclasses as objects plus a Prolog like theorem prover (where every rule begins with a cute) makes it easier to reason about something rather complicated, and gives me access to a body of literatures and design principles that apply to my problem.  Thinking about C++ templates as a functional language sort of like Haskell makes them easier to reason about also.  I generally try to understand the weird edges of mathematical systems by describing them in terms of axioms I already know.  You dont need ring theory to explain integers.",1
"I want to send the list<int> through TCP, and I've already get the server and client connected. Now, I need send the list<int> data from client to server. I know the method send() is based on char* or char[]. I don't know how to deal with list<int>. Thank you very much",1

"@DrakeGuan: You should change the title of your question to reflect your last comment. What's the difference between pip and setup.py isn't much of a question, it seems like you're actually interested in something a bit more specific.",1
"Sure, Thanks a lot!",1
"@DrakeGuan If you want the behaviour of `pip`, use `pip`.",1
"That's somewhat misleading, though - `pip` does use `setup.py`. I'm sure if you get the right options, or possibly use a wrapper script, it's possible to get the same results with setup.py.",1
"This is incorrect. In most cases, pip does download the package from PyPI, unzip it and run the setup.py script (albeit with some extra options). If you try to have pip install from a tarball for example without a setup.py, you'll get an error saying so.",1
"@ThomasK Sure, but that's not the question - the question is why the one does not give identical results to the other.",1
"@Marcin: Obviously they're not the same program: they have different names. But your answer fails to highlight the connection (one calls the other), or explain how to get `setup.py` to do what the OP wants. So it's technically correct, but not useful. @vartec has provided what the OP was almost certainly looking for.",1
@Marcin: Implying that they're entirely separate when `pip` calls `setup.py` is misleading.,1
"@ThomasK Not really. `pip` probably also uses `list`, but it doesn't follow that they are connected. The question does not ask ""how can I re-implement `pip` myself"".",1
"@Marcin: In the context of installing a package, pip and setup.py are clearly connected.",1
"@ThomasK They may be ""connected"" but the question doesn't ask ""are they connected"" - it asks why they don't have the exact same behaviour, and the answer is because they are not supposed to. That's all there is to it; how they achieve those effects is not relevant.",1
@ThomasK What other answer is there? There is no reason whatsoever to expect them to have the same behaviour. You might as well complain that I haven't dumped the whole code for pip in my answer.,1
@Marcin: Of course you can expect them to have similar behaviour: they both serve to install a Python package. It's different behaviour that needs explanation. As for another answer: @vartec's answer is a good start - providing a single option to `setup.py` makes it behave like `pip`. That's relevant and likely useful.,1
"@ThomasK Why does different behaviour need explanation? `pip` does not advertise that it provides identical behaviour (nor vice versa). In so far as they are supposed to be similar, they are similar: they install a python package. To expect a different explanation is like asking why you and I don't use the same writing style: neither of us has indicated that we would.",1
@Marcin: Different behaviour requires explanation because the question is about the difference in behaviour. Where would humanity be if we never asked how or why?,1
"@Marcin: Almost all code questions could be answered by reading enough source, but asking can give more useful information more quickly. Re different things: see red/blue example above.",1
"@ThomasK The reason why you don't perceive blue and red as exactly the same thing is because they are not exactly the same thing. There is no deeper explanation than that. If you want to inquire into the mechanisms of perception, that is a different question.",1
"@Marcin: In both the OP's question and my red/blue example, saying ""because they're different"" does not convey any information that the asker did not already know. Assuming the question is posed in order to gain information, an answer that does not provide information has no value. A useful answer to the OP's question might discuss how the difference is implemented, or why developers chose different mechanisms. For the red/blue conundrum, a useful answer might cover wavelengths of light, pigments, and colour receptors in the eye.",1
"@Marcin: The details of the way that the programme/eye works can be informative and interesting. Given that the question is asked to gain information, if the literal answer to the question contains no information, we can infer that we have misunderstood what the asker wants. In that case, we can attempt to infer the question they meant to ask, and provide useful information. This process does not always work perfectly, but it's better than an answer with no information.",1
"@ThomasK You may doubt your powers of comprehension, but I am confident in my own. When someone asks a nonsensical question, I assume they don't know that what they are asking is nonsensical, rather than inferring that it is an oblique way of soliciting a general disquisition on the topics mentioned. In that case, informing them that their question is nonsensical is new information.",1
"@Marcin: No, the question can be clearly understood to have a rational answer, more specific than a general discussion. Possible readings are ""how can I make them behave in the same way"" (which vartec answered), ""how do they achieve different results"" (similar), or ""why did the developers choose different mechanisms?"" (we can presume the `pip` developers were aware of the other mechanism).",1
"@ThomasK Leave the votes of others out of it - you are still arguing that I should make up a new question. If you want this to be a different question, go ahead and edit it.",1
"@Marcin: The votes of others became relevant when the discussion moved to what SO is about. In as much as SO is a community, what it is about is determined by the opinions of its members.",1
"@ThomasK Well, if you really want to argue about that, it turns out that SO users don't have to leave a reasoned explanation for their downvotes. For example, I am getting a bunch of downvotes on old questions, which I assume come from you (for obvious reasons) and vartec (whenever he sees my handle he is reminded that I once pointed out an error in one of his answers). So no, they don't really convey much information.",1
"@Marcin: I have not gone back to downvote your other answers, and I do not intend to.",1
@ThomasK Perhaps vartec is feeling extra insecure today.,1

"I **will** downvote any answer that is clearly wrong. @Marcin: if you can name any of your **correct** answers that I've allegedly downvoted, don't be shy, mention it.",1
"@vartec You know that I can't tell who is downvoting my answers, especially as you never leave comments. One presumes that is because you have no valid criticisms.",1

"Andrew, please check WickedFan's correctly referenced linked from MSDN. Points are represented as POINT(lat,long,SRID). Consider a case where data needs to be converted from geography to geometry. There are several ways of doing this. One of which is to use STAsText which produces the text Point(lat,long) etc. This will NOT work. As the geography version creates the wrong text but the geometry insertion expected Point(x,y) etc. This method also allows for change of projection.",1
"Damien_The_Unbeliever, please check the example i gave and my reply to Andrew. WickedFan also correctly provided the reference to MSDN documentation of the definition of POINT. In this case i am trying to convert large amount of data from geography to geometry and change the projection at the same time. Hence the reason for using STAasText and not the binary version. STAasText for geography should return the value of POINT as per definition on MSDN.",1

Where on the globe do you think that this point is located? The convention in WKT is `long lat`, not `lat long`. This is different from the convention you may have expected but it's *not* a bug.

"i already write a tons of ideas. First making a list and join the spliting , i get something like ['A1','A10'] but i cannot access to A or 1. After maybe using the string and using their access but i get confused to check EX my string can be
A1 A10
B14 B10

How i can check if after the letter , have 2 or 1 number?

errors are clearly shown in the error stack !,1
i know they're telling me the erros. but these errors simply don't exist.,1
You need to define the `enum` first and then use them in the function declaration. You have reversed the order.,1

"Unfortunately, though compilers are very good at assembling machine code from well-formed source code, they are remarkably bad at assembling error-messages.  All of them are bad, (and linkers worse:).  One syntax error can generate pages of utter rubbish as the compiler digs itself an ever-bigger hole. Often, the only thing you can do is look at the first line flagged as erroneous, carefully examine it and 'mess about' until you find out what is really causing the problem, (eg. using enums before declaring them).",1

"if you had to enter the number of children you plan to have, do you think you need decimals there, or will a natural number (no decimals) suffice ? Next to this, there are performance reasons.",1
Floats and doubles also have a lot of precision problems that integers do not have.,1
"In addition to Stultuske's comment, floating point arithmetics are a bit of a nightmare",1
"Some of the bits in floating point numbers are used for an exponent, so the range of integer values of a float (which is 32 bits) is smaller than the range of an int (32 bits). For instance, [this link](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/flintmax.html) says that the largest consecutive integer in IEEE single precision is 16777216 (2^24), which is far smaller than the largest integer in an equivalent integer type,  2147483647 (2^31 - 1)",1
@Stultuske realy good example,1
"*""You can keep any integer number in a variable of type double.""*--try to compare `(double)5_000_000_000_000L` and `(double)4_999_999_999_999L` to see why you're wrong.",1

"I think it returns the expected result, but maybe not the desired result. :) So I assume your problem is the comments outside the html elements.",1
I understand the answer is unhelpful (especially since the question is also tagged C++). However by providing the length of the string in another variable you effectively make zero-terminated strings capable of everyhting length-prefixed strings are capable of with the same performance.,1
At that point it's not a null terminated string. It's a string prefixed by a length. And good luck passing that thing around.,1

Add a space in the macro. Eg: `#define operator-10` --> `#define operator -10` and do the same for the other macros,1
The compiler gives you the line no: with error description(quite sufficient to understand),1
please consistently indent the code for readability by us humans.  Suggest 4 spaces after every opening brace: '{' and un-indent before every closing brace: '}',1
"the compiler is telling you exactly what line the error (usually syntax error) is on AND what the error is.   Suggest enabling line number on your editor, go to the indicated line, fix the syntax/spelling/whatever.",1
white space between tokens is (almost) always necessary.  white space between code blocks makes code much easier for us humans to read.,1
"regarding this line: 'return(symbol=='\0'||symbol==' '||symbol=='\t');' '\0' is not normally considered a white space characters.  However, '\n' is considered white space.",1
"always indent with spaces, not tabs.   This is because tabs are not a consistent width.  The actual width depends on the settings of the individual word processor or editor",1

What are you trying to do with this `Console.WriteLine(nbOccurences);`?,1
"it looks like you want to return the value of `m`. You should do that by making `nbOccurrences` `public int nbOccurrences` and `return m;` at the end. Then, assign the result by doing `int occurences = n1.nbOccurrences(test123, chiffrebase);`. Finally, do `Console.WriteLine(occurrences);`. The problem is that your method has no output, so it can't give anything to the `WriteLine` function that will be sent to the console (how does it know what to put there?). And also, `nbOccurrences` by itself doesn't *run* the function, just names it.",1

The point is your example does not justify the mechanism when sensible design using basic mechanisms of the language suffice in your example situation.  More generally perhaps C++ exception handling is what you need.,1
"@Clifford - yes it is just an example, its point is to illustrate what I want to achieve, not how it makes sense in actual code. Unfortunately, I cannot use C++.",1
You are reinventing `longjmp` if you want that to be portable and general (and compatible with recursive functions),1
"@BasileStarynkevitch - well, not all of our systems come with a spare 150 gigs of ram to afford to be reasonable with a billion `longjmp`s.",1
"A billion `longjmp`  will generally use a constant memory space of a hundred bytes. They won't even spend a single megabyte, and the billion calls to `longjmp` will require a few seconds in total, each of them lasting a few dozens of nanoseconds...",1
@BasileStarynkevitch - somehow and amazingly so you are STILL missing the point that it is about error handling and achieving in practice stack unwingding. So those billion jumps will require a billion buffers. In fact the buffers will end up being there even if no jumps are made. So to my question about zero cost error handling you are answering with a solution with an impossible cost.,1
"No, my improved answer show that there is no billion buffer in heap, only one single `jmp_buf`  *temporarily* on the call stack.",1
"So how do you trace back your N > 1 number of steps with only one jump buffer? Nobody is talking about heap, but the deeper you go, the more buffers you leave behind so you can make the jump if you have to. You can at best limit it to one buffer for each stack frame, reusing the same buffer if there are more than one error prone operations per frame.",1
"Please read more about `longjmp`. It can unwind dozens of thousands of call frames in constant time, and most call stacks don't have that much. A typical call stack cannot exceed a few megabytes on most laptops",1
"I am well aware of the typical stack sizes, but even though the stack as a memory buffer is a flat object, what happens inside has a tree structure. Storing a jump buffer on every frame in a deep call chain will run out of stack space in no time. Since even if the buffer only stores a few registers, it is still a constant size construct. Might have been nice if the compiler actually trimmed it down to only what is needed to store a particular state.",1
"See my example. You don't store a `jmp_buf` in most call frames, only in some initial ones.",1
"As a caution: let's keep this discussion civil, and avoid pointed comments about other users.",1
"@BasileStarynkevitch if you don't store each of the steps then the stack unwinding will not collect all the objects in between, it will all leak, which is why your solution is utterly useless. The goal is not to get back to where you started, it is to do so AND properly collect all objects along the call stack. This will require a LOT of jump buffers and will result in massive CPU and MEMORY OVERHEAD.",1
you could provide the code you have already written and point out where you are struggeling. This would make it more likely that you´ll be getting an answer.,1
"You'll do better here if you post code and ask questions about specific difficulties.  This isn't a ""haz the codez"" site.",1

"how do you imagine a situation that it fails? Except when a null pointer is passed, otherwise it's just a comparison that returns how the strings compares",1
It will fail if the strings aren't null terminated?,1
"The only ways `strcmp()` can fail are if you pass one or two null pointers, or if the 'strings' are not properly null terminated (but they need to be similar chunks of data because `strcmp()` stops as soon as there's a difference).   However, that invokes undefined behaviour so anything can happen and it is valid.",1
Do you understand the difference between a keyword and a function call?,1
"yes, I understand, what i wanna know is how compiler handles int, char etc ?",1
"A fundamental type is not a function. It does not need to be declared. It's fundamental. Nor do basic keywords need to be declared. How would you declare such things, without using... basic keywords?",1
"With all due respect, no, you don't. Please read a basic C book first.",1
"The compiler knows how to handle basic types and keywords because their behaviour is specified by the Standard and the compiler must implement this behaviour using whichever resources are available on the architecture used for compilation. This is circular logic. The compiler must know how to do such basic things, otherwise it... couldn't compile.",1
thats what i wanna know ? how the compiler knows ?,1
Are you asking about how a compiler knows the spec for the supported language?,1
"`printf` is not _defined_ in a header, but only _declared_!",1
"languages have grammar, constructs, (sometimes) types, and keywords. Functions are build using these things that make up a language. `printf` is a function. `return` is a keyword. `int` and `char` are types. The basic format of a function is defined by the grammar (ie `return_type name (args) { function body }`. Compiling an expression like `int a` doesn't call a function, it's simply using the language. `printf()` is invoking a function. If the compiler doesn't know about that function, there's a problem. It's pretty obvious, isn't it?",1
@user123456987: A compiler is just another program; it reads input (your code) and processes it according to a set of built-in rules.  It recognizes keywords like `int` and `char` and `return` because it was *written* to recognize those things.,1
This example does not show any use of exception filters.,1
This is standard way to filter exception in c#6.0,1
Take a look again at what exactly exception filters are. You are not using an exception filter in your example. There's a proper example in [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22864936/247702) posted a year before yours.,1

"It is a reasonable thing to argue that the standard is broken regarding this being allowed to be null for non-vcalls (I don't necessarily agree but that's a fine opinion to hold). For other optimizations (e.g. the ""Felix-gcc"" one) it is very hard to teach a compiler what is OK to optimize and what a human intended. That is architecturally very unclean and might be practically impossible. Linus Torvalds has made the same error once about an optimized out NULL check.",1
"'pretty much every real-world program is undefined' - not sure what is the basis of this claim. The systems I work with do not rely on undefined behaviour, and when such is discovered (because people make mistakes), it is treated as bug and fixed, rather than blaming it on the compiler.",1
@Ben you can turn on that behavior using a switch and I would not condemn you for doing that. I find the idea of safer versions of C and C++ very useful. But it costs your performance in certain loops. C generally is a language that is supposed to be so close to the metal that there is not enough room below C and above assembler for another language.,1
"@boot4life The problem with a switch is it is old code which needs that behaviour, that is the code where by definition the makefile does not have the switch because it did not exist when the code was written.",1
"@boot4life, actually those who argue against this kind of optimization want semantics which are closer to ""the metal"".",1

"@hvd, no it isn't. Common practice is to use the latest compiler for each new release. I'm glad you version-control your compiler and BDIFF the different versions looking for breaking changes in the compiled output before upgrading, but most people just don't.",1
"@Ben You've read my comment just barely enough to type up a response to it, but clearly not nearly enough to understand what I wrote. You were saying that for pre-existing code, there is no way that their Makefiles specify any options needed to make it work that did not exist at the time. I'm saying that those Makefiles do typically specify that the user can provide custom options. Your response to that totally misses my point. It's not about how many developers / users make use of that ability, it's merely about the ability being there, when you say it's not.",1
"@hvd, I understand that the user can ""specify options needed to make it work"", and for an automated build system, you can set these options as a global default. I get it. My point is that by default **there is no reason for them to believe that there is any need for them to do it**. There are no new warnings produced, it just compiles. How can they know that actually there is a breaking change there? They don't read the compiler release notes, **they assume the compiler writer is on their side**. Unfortunately it seems **he is not**. Breaking changes need to be opt-in not opt-out.",1
"Step number one in writing robust correct code is to know your tools.

Looks pretty much defined to me.,1
*What will be the length of array containing n numbers [...]* Well... `n`?,1
`n` elements or `a.length` elements.,1
n. Arrays are of a fixed size.,1
"If the size of an array is [_undefined_](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/undefined), you cannot get it, because it is **undefined**. However, your array very well has a [_defined_](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/defined) length. Oh, and: please learn about the [`sizeof`](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#6.5.3.4p2) and array and its length (i.e. number of elements).",1

"@FredK: Me too:-) But as given, it can be any, so OP should clarify once he actually knows what he is asking. But that seems to be another fire-and-forget question.",1
"After all the jesting I can inform that `printf(""Array a length is %d\n"", sizeof a / sizeof a[0]);` will do the job, at least in C. It's exactly the same with `b` but note that I changed the narrative from ""size"" to ""length"". Having said that, my puzzlement about the comment *`Size of the array may change adding/deleting elements`* turned to wonder, even mirth, since it is a fixed size array ;). How can you possibly keep track of its usage without another variable holding that information?",1

"@Martin: I guess it depends on your workflow.  In my approach, I never use the index directly.  When I want to save my work, I just do full commits with `git commit -a`.

@VincentSavard `std::wstring` then?,1
@AlgirdasPreidžius There is no built in support for Unicode in C++.  Even the higher width character strings are problematic.  If you need unicode in C++ it is best to use a library.,1
@VincentSavard: In what way does `std::string` not support unicode?,1
@NathanOliver [libiconv](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Generic-Charset-Conversion.html#Generic-Charset-Conversion) does a pretty good job when character conversion is necessary.,1
@πάνταῥεῖ Which reinforces my comment of best to use a library.,1
"@BenjaminLindley: `std::string(""é"").length() == 2`. There's no notion of encoding in a `std::string`, which makes it very different from Python's `str`.",1
"@NathanOliver _""Which reinforces my comment""_ Of course, and it was meant so. As far I can see that library can be made working on serveral platforms.",1
"@VincentSavard: Okay. I thought you were referring to the often repeated confusion that you need a wide character string to store unicode.

@BenjaminLindley And you can store images in `std::string`. But this is not *supported* – as Unicode is not.,1

What doesn't work? #What error do you get? What have you done to troubleshoot this?,0
this makes no sense(returns a constant if you initialize the variables) and doesn't even compile because you use uninitialized variables.,0
"*if the guy types in ""haha lol XD""*  ....then you should probably beat the crap out of him.",0
This question appears to be off-topic because it is too-localised.,0
"Did you try looking for ""loop javascrip"" or ""javascript interval"" ? Do it.",0
"Come one, what's the code you've attempted?",0
Good luck getting one.  I would expect these to be totally identical.,0
"A logical explanation of what, exactly? *Why* they're nearly identical? Because they're essentially the same comparison.",0
This is horrible advice - and only artificially extends how many more fragments you can pack in - this problem still remains. Google explicitly states not to use this to address memory leaks.,0
completely incorrect answer,0
"Yeah, this doesn't work. Produces an exact duplicate of the gif.",0
"I've never seen a -23 answer before. Err, sorry -24.",0
Unlucky the guy's answer got accepted because that pins the answer up. You often only see a few because they sink to the bottom pretty quickly so nobody pays attention to it. :),0
"whenever you learn a new language, the first thing you should read are the operators. read the reference before posting",0
Very basic question that smells like homework.,0
@Jack - You need to understand how to accomplish it.. someone else doing it won't help. I really suggest P&P - paper pencil,0
Did you forget to have *coffee* today?,0
Please provide what you have tried so far.,0
"`!` is an unary operator, so-called **not**. Do googling about C operators unary/bitwise ones",0

What help do you want? And ***what have you tried***?,0
So what have you tried?,0
And you want we create your code?,0

"Wait, what? You want me to help you steal a bunch of usernames and passwords!?",0
This isn't a place to have your script written for you. Search for perl `open` on how to open and read your file. You'll probably need some regexes to figure out what's a heading and what's a variable.,0
"Why on earth are you doing three different queries to get data from your `members` table?!  You're selecting a field you already have in the first query, some (not necessarily related) user's encrypted password in the next query, and then you're selecting *every single userid* in your members table.",0

This answer doesn't absolutely reflect the point of question... the asker wants no view controller.,0
@Botanick I believe I already did. Globals are bad and what you have in your code are fancy globals. I suggest you watch the videos in teresko's answer.,0
Just in case anyone reading this answer in the future thinks it is correct.. it is not. MattMcDonald's answer is *leaps and bounds* better than this. Also ***NEVER*** listen to w3schools. They do not know what they are talking about and will misguide you.,0
There are C# to VB.NET converters on the internet that can give you a big head start on a lot of this stuff...,0
"OK, so you've told us the query and that you need help.  Neither of those things are questions. **What's the question?** What part are you having trouble with?",0

You're asking about general database scaling. Your questions range from entry-level to senior-dba level which is causing a lot of frustrating here. You're not going to learn 5+ years of experience in one question/answer environment.

Start slow and work your way from there.. don't ask ridiculous questions and learn when you're out of your league. That's the best thing you can take away from this question.,0
