Ideologically, a function should do only one thing, so input should just take input and hand that input off to someone who knows how best to store it. The simpler a function is, the easier it is to debug. So `char input_type(char sport_type[], int index)` should probably be `char input_type()`, read the user input into a temporary value, test the value and return the value when it's good.",1
